40,2,149.68,151.01,the green is twenty,,
41,1,154.47,159.75,[this] is heavier than [this] one so [this] is twenty [this] is heavier than [this] one,"a14-PurpleBlock, a164-YellowBlock",[p] [g] [g] [p] [g]
43,2,160.38,161.33,[this] is definitely the heaviest,,[y]
44,1,161.42,163.86,ok so let's try purple,"a15-YellowBlock, a16-PurpleBlock, a144-PurpleBlock",
45,1,164.07,168.25,ok so [that]'s heavier ok ok so greather than twenty,,[p]
47,2,168.46,170.07,[it]'s greater than twenty,,[p]
48,2,170.23,172.5,so i can put one one and see if [it]'s thirty,,[p]
49,1,170.1,173.01,right what if we put ten on [that],"a17-RedBlock, a145-RedBlock",[g]
50,2,174.48,183.63,teeter teeter we know [it]'s less than forty and greater than twenty so [it]'s likely thirty we don't have any other options [it] [it]'s gonna be thirty,"a18-BlueBlock, a165-BlueBlock",[p] [p] [-] [p]
51,1,175.5,181.24,what if i do [this] ok so less than forty likely thirty ok,"a19-BlueBlock, a146-BlueBlock",[-]

56,1,187.35,197.24,ok and then so if i take [this] one off yeah thirty put [that]'s going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty,"a20-PurpleBlock, a21-RedBlock, a22-RedBlock, a23-GreenBlock, a147-PurpleBlock, a148-YellowBlock, a166-GreenBlock, a242-YellowBlock",[gr] [y]
59,1,205.77,218.67,[this] looks almost a little bit heavier but [it] is [it]'s close enough so fifty is not an option yeah definitely let's put sixty,,[pg] [-] [-]
