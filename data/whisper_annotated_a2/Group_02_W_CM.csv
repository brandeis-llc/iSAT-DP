18,1,62,66,"yeah, [it]'s like a bit slow to level up.",,[-]
19,1,66,82,so i'd imagine if [this] needle goes over the red line [that] means [they]'re probably equal,"a1-RedBlock, a2-BlueBlock, a194-RedBlock, a195-BlueBlock",[-] [-] [rb]
20,2,82,86,"i, i, i think [they] are especially since [it] keeps going back in a",,[rb] [-]
23,1,86,92,"yeah, [they] also just like look relatively the same size",,[rb]
24,1,92,97,"size, but [they] could be different material, you know",,[rb]
26,1,100,102,"yeah, so [that] one's probably 10 grams too.",a3-BlueBlock,[b]
28,1,102,104,"and then if [that]'s 10 grams, then we put 2. and then,",a4-YellowBlock,[r]
29,2,104,108,so i'm going to hold back on [that] one because i think [it]'s the heaviest.,a65-YellowBlock,[y] [y]
31,2,108,112,the green one,a5-BlueBlock,
34,2,114,119,and [that] looks like [it] might be about even.,a6-YellowBlock,[-] [rbg]

55,1,167,169,"yeah, [it] does.","a12-PurpleBlock, a70-PurpleBlock",[-]
56,1,169,181,i guess [it]'s leveling out a bit more,"a13-GreenBlock, a14-RedBlock, a71-RedBlock",[-]
61,2,196,200,"and there's no increments of five, so you could probably just go with 30 on [that]",,[-]
62,2,200,218,on [that] note,,[-]
