11,1,72.45,76.17,seems like [it] might be about the same,,[rb]
12,3,80.52,85.29,i would agree so [this] one's ten,"a3-BlueBlock, a179-BlueBlock",[b]
16,2,97.44,99.78,[this] is a sensitive scale,,[-]
17,1,102.3,104.28,[that]'s looking pretty even,,[rgb]
20,2,109.44,113.19,probably [that] big sucker,,[y]
21,1,109.44,113.19,so [this] one is noticeably heavier than,"a11-GreenBlock, a184-None, a185-GreenBlock",[y]
22,1,113.94,115.95,the purple ish one,,
23,1,116.79,125.37,making sure [that] [it] didn't have the weight at the bottom,,[-] [p]
24,2,116.79,125.37,[it]'s just different at the bottom [that]'s a so [that]'s a ten and a twenty right now right [that]'s looking,"a12-PurpleBlock, a186-GreenBlock",[p] [rg] [rg] [rgb]
27,2,127.62,131.76,their increments of ten i would say [that]'s probably,,[rgbpy]
28,1,131.79,135.96,yeah [it] looks a little,,[-]
29,2,131.79,135.96,cause [that]'s also a twenty let's double check [that] [that]'s not also a twenty,,[g] [-] [p]
30,2,136.44,141.09,cause [it] um just [that] one there,,[-] [g]
31,3,136.44,141.09,is [this] one a twenty,"a13-BlueBlock, a14-RedBlock, a126-GreenBlock, a163-RedBlock",[b]
32,2,141.18,146.85,ok so [it]'s more than twenty but [it] almost seems like the thirty takes [it] past but,"a15-BlueBlock, a16-GreenBlock, a127-RedBlock, a128-RedBlock, a164-None",[p] [-] [-]
33,2,148.2,150.18,[it]'s so sensitive,,[-]
34,2,154.32,162.57,if [they]'re only in increments of ten [it] has to be,,[rbgpy [p]
35,1,154.32,162.57,i think yeah [it] has to be thirty [it],,[p] [-]
36,3,154.32,162.57,i think [it] could also be the position,a17-RedBlock,[-]
37,2,162.84,171.21,so big blue is probably thirty,,
39,1,162.84,171.21,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,"a18-PurpleBlock, a129-PurpleBlock",
44,3,186.24,190.92,yeah [that]'s considerably heavier so [this] one did we say [this] was thirty,a23-PurpleBlock,[y] [p] [p]
45,3,191.01,195.21,and [this] was ten,,[b]
46,2,191.01,195.21,yeah [that]'s thirty green is twenty,"a24-BlueBlock, a25-RedBlock",[p]
47,3,195.24,199.41,[it]'s definitely not thirty so [it] has to,,[y] [y]
48,2,195.24,199.41,red and small blue are both ten,"a26-RedBlock, a27-PurpleBlock, a189-PurpleBlock",
49,3,201.21,203.97,but [it]'s too heavy,,[y]
51,1,205.44,211.5,[this] is fifty on here so then,,[gp]
52,2,205.44,211.5,yeah green and big blue,,
53,1,211.56,222.66,big blue,,
54,3,211.56,222.66,did we try forty we did try forty because [this] one's thirty and then [this] one's or [this] one's twenty,,[p] [g] [g]
55,2,211.56,222.66,unless she's messing with us and some of [these] are in increments of five,"a28-PurpleBlock, a29-BlueBlock, a130-GreenBlock, a165-BlueBlock, a190-PurpleBlock",[rbgpy]
56,1,223.5,226.56,bib blue was forty,,
57,2,223.5,226.56,so [that] should be forty right there,"a30-RedBlock, a191-RedBlock",[pb]
58,1,237.36,243.39,i would say [that] [it] is at least closest to fifty,,[-] [y]
59,2,237.36,243.39,i would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're,,
60,2,243.57,246.33,forced with [these],"a31-YellowBlock, a192-YellowBlock",[rbpg]
66,1,268.74,271.38,yellow is fifty,,
67,2,273.39,279.48,green's twenty big blue's thirty,,
68,3,273.39,279.48,yeah i guess [that] one's,,[p]
69,2,280.11,286.44,oh [that]'s purple you're right,,[p]
70,3,280.11,286.44,i think [that] one's purple so blue was ten and purple was thirty,,[p]
72,3,291.99,299.55,so red was ten yellow was fifty we're great,,
73,2,291.99,299.55,we got [it] right good job team,,[-]
