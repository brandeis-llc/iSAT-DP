4,2,27.15,28.38,can we use [this] piece of paper,,[-]
13,1,81.33,85.53,yeah [it]'s like a bit slow to level up,,[-]
14,1,86.82,88.95,so i would imagine if [this],,[-]
15,1,88.98,91.58,needle goes over the red line [that] means [they]'re probably equal,,[-] [rb]
16,2,92.58,94.65,and i i think [they] are,,[rb]
17,2,94.77,97.05,especially since [it] keeps going back in a,,[-]
18,1,97.11,102.39,yeah [they] also just look like relatively the same size but [they] could be different material you know,"a3-BlueBlock, a64-Block",[rb] [rb]
20,1,104.08,106.23,so [that] one is probably ten grams too,"a4-YellowBlock, a65-YellowBlock",[b]
22,1,108.06,111.3,and then if [that]'s ten grams then we have a two,a5-BlueBlock,[b]
23,2,112.29,117.87,so i'm going to hold back on [that] one because i think [it]'s the heaviest,"a6-YellowBlock, a66-YellowBlock",[y] [y]
26,2,120.5,121.59,the green one,"a7-GreenBlock, a196-GreenBlock",
28,2,124.68,127.02,and [that] looks like [it] might be about even,,[-] [-]
30,1,138,140.31,there we go [that]'s better,,[-]
31,2,141.27,146.91,well on the first go through i noticed how [it] bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then,,[-]
32,1,144.92,149.08,yeah so [that]'s probably twenty grams,"a8-GreenBlock, a68-GreenBlock",[g]
37,2,158.13,164.17,so knowing [that] uh oh sorry the green one was yeah,a11-GreenBlock,[-]
40,3,167.13,169.11,[this] is what we are looking at next,"a12-PurpleBlock, a70-PurpleBlock",[p]
43,2,195.93,199.5,yeah but [it] still feels like [it]'s leaning towards the two blocks,,[-] [-]
44,1,199.75,200.82,oh yeah [it] does,,[-]
45,1,216.87,220.01,i guess [it]'s leveling out a bit more but,,[-]
47,2,221.4,225.41,i guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on [that],,[p]
51,1,233.61,236.49,putting [this] on [that] side checking [this] one,"a17-PurpleBlock, a18-YellowBlock, a73-PurpleBlock, a74-YellowBlock",[p] [-] [y]
53,2,247.95,250.17,so [that]'s the twenty and the thirty,,[gp]
54,2,255.36,258.01,[it]'s leaning towards one side a bit much,"a20-GreenBlock, a76-GreenBlock",[-]
55,1,258.08,260.67,yeah we could probably try [it] with just ten,a21-BlueBlock,[-]
62,1,288.12,290.1,wait did we mix [these] up or,a26-PurpleBlock,[gp]
64,3,293.66,294.75,so [these] are both ten,,[rb]
66,3,297.06,297.75,blue or purple,,
68,1,300.51,302.82,i think purple or,a29-BlueBlock,
69,2,303.75,309.48,[this] would be blue [this] would be purple yeah i thought [they] were both blue until,,[b] [p] [bp]
70,1,303.15,307.25,blue yeah no i see [that]'s like a navy blue,,[b]
78,2,343.98,346.75,wait a mystery block,,
