1,61.23,64.67,i guess if this red one's ten grams,"red, this","a1-RedBlock, a177-RedBlock"
2,63.42,66.0,we got red ten,red,"a2-BlueBlock, a178-BlueBlock"
1,72.45,76.17,seems like it might be about the same,it,
3,80.52,85.29,i would agree yeah so this one's ten,this,"a3-BlueBlock, a179-BlueBlock"
2,97.44,99.78,this is a sensitive scale,this,
1,102.3,103.5,that's looking pretty even,that,
1,110.82,113.19,so this one is noticeably heavier than,this,"a12-PurpleBlock, a186-GreenBlock"
2,109.44,110.75,probably that big sucker,that,"a11-GreenBlock, a184-None, a185-GreenBlock"
1,113.94,115.95,the purple ish one,purple,
1,119.42,121.75,making sure that it didn't have the weight at the bottom,"that, it",
2,116.79,125.37,it's just stuff written at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking,"it, that, that, that",
2,127.62,130.21,they're increments of ten i would say that's probably,"they, that",
2,130.66,135.96,cause that's also a twenty let's double check that that's not also a twenty,"that, that, that",a13-BlueBlock
1,131.79,132.58,yeah it looks a little,it,
2,136.44,141.09,cause it um just that one there,"it, that","a14-RedBlock, a126-GreenBlock, a163-RedBlock"
3,137.36,138.33,is this one a twenty,this,
2,141.18,146.85,ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but,"it, it, it","a15-BlueBlock, a16-GreenBlock, a127-RedBlock, a128-RedBlock, a164-None"
2,148.2,150.18,it's so sensitive,it,
2,157.58,159.58,if they're only in increments of ten it has to be,"they, it",
1,156.33,161.08,i think yeah it has to be thirty it,"it, it",
3,160.58,162.57,i think it could also be the position,it,a17-RedBlock
2,164.46,166.67,so big blue is probably thirty,blue,
1,168.42,171.21,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,yellow,"a18-PurpleBlock, a129-PurpleBlock"
3,186.24,190.92,yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty,"that, this, this",a23-PurpleBlock
3,191.01,192.58,and this was ten,this,a24-BlueBlock
2,192.61,195.21,yeah that's thirty green is twenty,"green, that",a25-RedBlock
2,195.24,196.42,red and small blue are both ten,"red, blue",a26-RedBlock
3,196.52,199.41,it's definitely not thirty so it has to,"it, it","a27-PurpleBlock, a189-PurpleBlock"
3,201.21,202.25,but it's too heavy,it,
1,202.58,203.97,so that's,that,
1,205.44,209.58,this is fifty on here so then,this,
2,208.84,211.5,yeah green and big blue,"green, blue",
3,211.56,222.66,did we try forty we did try forty because this one's thirty and then this one's or this one's twenty so this,"this, this, this, this","a28-PurpleBlock, a29-BlueBlock, a130-GreenBlock, a165-BlueBlock, a190-PurpleBlock"
1,211.56,211.92,big blue,blue,
2,215.67,219.67,unless she's messing with us and some of these are in increments of five,these,
2,224.5,226.56,so that should be forty right there,that,
1,223.5,226.56,big blue was forty,blue,"a30-RedBlock, a191-RedBlock"
2,239.41,243.39,i would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're,yellow,
1,237.36,240.75,i would say that it is at least closest to fifty,"that, it",
2,243.57,246.33,forced with these,these,"a31-YellowBlock, a192-YellowBlock"
1,268.74,271.38,yellow is fifty,yellow,
2,273.39,278.25,green's twenty big blue's thirty,"green, blue",
3,278.11,279.48,yeah i guess that one's,that,
3,280.11,286.44,i think that one's purple so blue was ten and then purple was thirty,"purple, blue, purple, that",
2,282.21,282.5,oh that's purple you're right,"purple, that",
3,291.99,299.55,so red was ten yellow was fifty we're great,"red, yellow",
2,294.75,295.92,we got it right good job team,it,
3,318.33,320.7,is it heavy,it,"a132-YellowBlock, a133-PurpleBlock"
2,321.27,324.69,we should each do it separate and see what we think,it,"a34-MysteryBlock, a134-YellowBlock, a135-GreenBlock, a136-YellowBlock"
3,324.75,325.91,just don't say it until you,it,"a137-BlueBlock, a166-RedBlock"
3,331.65,336.15,oh i guess we can see it,it,"a141-GreenBlock, a167-BlueBlock, a174-RedBlock"
2,368.76,374.55,we can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,that,"a52-MysteryBlock, a53-BlueBlock, a54-YellowBlock"
2,395.16,399.72,that's about as even as i can get it unless somebody can,"that, it","a56-YellowBlock, a57-MysteryBlock"
2,406.41,412.14,but let's let him do hands and then we'll we'll play with that but i'm thinking,that,"a58-YellowBlock, a142-MysteryBlock"
2,416.22,419.4,yeah maybe one of these,these,"a59-YellowBlock, a143-PurpleBlock"
3,417.17,418.42,i'm interested in this,this,
3,422.19,424.8,oh that's a heavy one,that,a61-BlueBlock
2,432.21,437.07,yeah so if you held if you hold them all in one and like yeah,them,"a64-RedBlock, a65-BlueBlock, a144-GreenBlock"
3,434.56,435.84,which ones twenty this one,this,
1,452.79,463.65,let's see how callibrated this is or,this,"a68-YellowBlock, a69-RedBlock, a148-BlueBlock, a170-GreenBlock, a175-PurpleBlock, a195-MysteryBlock, a197-YellowBlock"
2,465.93,467.67,so even when they're equal it leans,"they, it",
1,766.92,470.85,it leans slowly that way,"it, that",
1,474.99,481.42,purple and then let's put green and a ten,"purple, green","a71-PurpleBlock, a72-BlueBlock, a73-RedBlock, a149-MysteryBlock"
3,479.83,483.6,alright alright lemme just lemme just give it a go here,it,
2,491.66,495.67,that felt to me like it was heavier than all of those,"that, it, those",
3,488.94,498.63,so it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty,"it, it, that, it","a150-GreenBlock, a171-YellowBlock, a176-PurpleBlock, a196-MysteryBlock, a198-RedBlock, a199-BlueBlock"
3,498.84,504.3,i think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,that,
2,500.01,500.92,i would agree with that,that,
1,509.22,514.25,well and it could be past the end of sheet if they're trying to be tricky,"it, they",
2,519.25,529.86,who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,it,"a74-Mysteryblock, a172-YellowBlock"
1,530.22,532.84,drink enough coffee until it weighs the weight is,it,
3,532.95,534.84,how much is the yellow one again,yellow,
2,534.93,535.84,that one was fifty,that,
2,548.22,550.91,i'm i'm good with it it's real heavy,"it, it","a75-YellowBlock, a151-Mysteryblock"
3,558.75,553.77,here if anybody wants to yeah it's heavy,it,
3,556.95,560.34,these are the only i would go higher than one fifty,these,a80-PurpleBlock
1,560.49,564.03,see if some of these blocks weigh similar to my coffee,these,a81-YellowBlock
2,560.92,562.84,that's definitely our only options,that,
2,570.05,572.25,if he just said it off the bat i would be like wow,it,
1,569.13,577.86,i wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,"it, these","a83-YellowBlock, a84-BlueBlock, a85-PurpleBlock, a86-YellowBlock, a154-MysteryBlock"
1,578.37,589.08,so we can use that as an estimate or we can but we know how much these three weigh and if its about the same as the coffee,"that, these","a87-YellowBlock, a88-MysteryBlock, a89-GreenBlock, a90-YellowBlock, a91-YellowBlock, a155-RedBlock, a156-GreenBlock"
2,589.95,593.42,oh then we can start adding more is what he's saying ok got it,it,a92-GreenBlock
2,594.66,601.74,so and these three would be yellow purple and blue which would be a hundred right no ninety,"yellow, purple, blue, these",a93-YellowBlock
1,602.49,605.4,yeah if you wanna see and feel it and make sure it's,"it, it",
2,611.88,615.87,sure this might even be a tad tad heavier but,this,"a94-YellowBlock, a95-MysteryBlock"
2,624.84,628.75,i mean that does seem like we're getting closer interesting,that,"a97-YellowBlock, a157-MysteryBlock"
2,631.65,639.24,yeah ninety plus ninety so one eighty yeah i think the heaviest option and if it's wrong go one forty,it,
1,658.35,663.57,thirty oh it's the sum of the previous two weights,it,a101-YellowBlock
2,672.0,679.25,there's no way that's eighty it feels way heavier but the pattern sticks,"that, it","a102-MysteryBlock, a103-YellowBlock"
3,675.75,679.5,hey i'm that's some sound logic right there yeah,that,"a104-PurpleBlock, a105-YellowBlock, a106-YellowBlock, a107-PurpleBlock"
3,680.94,682.02,i like that idea,that,a108-YellowBlock
3,687.67,693.21,cause it's definitely not one fifty anyways so we might as well just,it,"a111-YellowBlock, a112-MysteryBlock"
2,684.75,687.25,yeah i guess now that my i mean,that,"a109-YellowBlock, a110-YellowBlock"
3,696.24,701.5,what do you guys think that makes sense yeah,that,
1,697.35,702.6,i i feel like it it i think it feels heaiver but,"it, it, it","a115-YellowBlock, a159-PurpleBlock"
2,705.18,712.56,why can't i think of what this pattern is right now the name for this pattern fib yeah so are we we're doing fib,"this, this",a116-MysteryBlock
1,708.08,710.33,it's the fibonacci sequence,it,
2,712.77,715.23,so then that would be there,that,
2,715.95,725.01,it's a good i mean it's the best we got i'm i'm ok with it i stand i stand to lose nothing here,"it, it, it","a117-MysteryBlock, a118-YellowBlock, a119-PurpleBlock"
2,726.15,728.01,we got it so given the hint,it,
3,732.43,734.04,it's way heavier than eighty,it,
2,730.62,732.75,gosh this thing felt like way heavier to me,this,"a120-PurpleBlock, a160-MysteryBlock"
1,734.13,735.08,we're done with this part,this,
3,734.63,740.83,yeah i think that's an idication of the alright can we get the scale back real quick,that,a121-MysteryBlock
2,734.16,737.33,yeah i want to see these on a scale full of,these,
1,780.48,781.33,i've got it,it,
2,789.83,792.27,yeah i wouldn't have picked that up that's fun,"that, that",
2,824.84,826.11,did it,it,
