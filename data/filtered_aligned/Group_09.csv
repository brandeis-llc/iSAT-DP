2,61.74,63.4,i would say that's equal probably,that,
1,77.08,77.75,i would say that's equal,that,
3,77.85,79.58,yeah it should be same i guess,it,
2,78.25,79.01,yeah that 's good,that,
1,79.83,82.33,yeah ok so that one will go,that,"a3-BlueBlock, a40-GreenBlock, a68-BlueBlock, a69-GreenBlock"
3,91.05,93.03,i think it's the,it,
2,96.66,97.83,yeah it's probably equal,it,
3,107.83,108.58,that's not,that,
1,130.26,133.35,that was twenty and ten right ok,that,
3,131.58,132.83,that was twenty ten yep,that,
1,140.7,146.1,the two the yellow and green i don't know just kidding,"yellow, green","a14-YellowBlock, a15-RedBlock, a16-GreenBlock, a44-RedBlock, a45-BlueBlock, a79-YellowBlock, a80-GreenBlock"
2,160.22,164.84,just like ever so slightly though so it's probably probably say that's equal,"it, that",
3,159.72,167.91,i think it's sixty so this one was twenty,"it, this","a17-PurpleBlock, a18-GreenBlock, a46-YellowBlock, a81-PurpleBlock, a82-YellowBlock"
3,168.42,170.83,this one was thirty so this should be fifty less,"this, this",a19-PurpleBlock
3,186.51,188.61,yellow is,yellow,
3,203.76,205.74,can i do it,it,
3,210.81,215.88,so it is ten yellow is fifty that's right green is twenty,"yellow, green, it, that",
3,216.03,222.27,yeah we are right which one is mystery block,mystery,
3,243.39,247.29,interesting it's heavier than that one so,"it, that","a20-MysteryBlock, a47-YellowBlock, a48-YellowBlock"
3,251.64,254.22,it's heavier than this too as well,"it, this","a21-MysteryBlock, a49-BlueBlock, a50-PurpleBlock, a59-YellowBlock"
3,272.49,276.51,maybe it will right i'm not sure,it,"a23-MysteryBlock, a54-GreenBlock, a63-YellowBlock, a85-PurpleBlock, a88-BlueBlock, a91-RedBlock"
2,279.15,281.37,honestly this one feels heavier still,this,
3,281.67,292.59,i feel like i'm going to do a comparison between like how heavy this one feels compared to was this the this was our heaviest right before oh the yellow one's heaviest compared and then compared to,"yellow, this, this, this","a24-MysteryBlock, a64-YellowBlock, a86-PurpleBlock, a89-BlueBlock, a92-RedBlock"
3,288.33,290.17,no the yellow one is the heaviest,yellow,
1,298.56,306.24,yeah i feel like oh we got all the way up to like one forty ok just kidding i thought it was just up to seventy i was like we'll just go with our maximum,it,a26-MysteryBlock
3,308.76,314.07,yeah so i guess it's fifty plus thirty eighty then forty,it,"a55-BlueBlock, a65-PurpleBlock, a87-YellowBlock, a90-GreenBlock"
3,314.34,318.24,one twenty it's higher than one twenty at least so maybe,it,
3,318.3,318.92,i don't know this,this,
2,319.65,321.04,i'd say it's probably at least one forty,it,
3,327.15,329.79,it can't be one fifty or we'll have the option of one fifty,it,
1,322.86,326.03,the red on the bottom for us,red,a27-RedBlock
2,333.63,336.51,i don't think it's one thirty,it,
3,336.99,340.35,ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok,it,
2,355.56,357.54,that's what i would say,that,
3,360.33,365.91,what it's eighty grams i feel like it's,"it, it",
1,361.17,367.17,eighty that's not right it's,"that, it",
3,389.08,384.87,um it's saying unable to connect our servers please shut internet servers and try again,it,
2,387.69,389.92,like no shot this is eighty grams,this,a29-MysteryBlock
2,394.26,396.17,unless they lied like,they,
3,396.02,400.53,yeah ok there's a mystery block two,mystery,a31-RedBlock
1,417.72,420.63,so we have a second mystery block that we don't know the weight of,"mystery, that",
3,433.11,441.39,yeah that was fifty um was twenty and this one was thirty,"that, this","a33-RedBlock, a35-GreenBlock, a36-GreenBlock, a37-PurpleBlock, a56-BlueBlock, a57-PurpleBlock"
1,434.08,436.58,what was this like was that fifty,"this, that",a34-YellowBlock
3,441.48,444.24,this one was two eighty,this,a38-MysteryBlock
2,454.41,459.18,i mean if you like sum these two you get that one and if you sum these two you get this one,"these, that, these, this",
2,459.42,462.78,sum these two you get that one so this one should be eighty,"these, that, this",
3,460.38,461.92,so it's kind of fibonacci series,it,
2,464.04,465.52,and then these two should be one thirty,these,
1,467.67,469.38,i would say that's sound logic,that,
2,481.59,482.92,um that's fibonacci series right,that,
1,487.33,484.42,unless it's not,it,
1,493.92,497.7,some sort of counting upwards by combining them,them,
3,500.46,502.89,call it swerve yeah,it,
1,515.92,520.95,looks kind of right yeah i like it,it,
