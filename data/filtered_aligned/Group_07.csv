3,98.5,101.75,i think so as well or i think it's the other way around uh,it,
2,107.31,109.09,it seems to be ten,it,
2,112.42,114.67,is that blue or purple this is blue i guess,"blue, purple, blue, that, this","a3-BlueBlock, a127-BlueBlock"
3,114.41,115.17,this is blue,"blue, this",
3,116.42,118.12,and this was ten,this,
2,119.25,123.5,and we can now we have twenty so we can try to put one of them,them,"a4-BlueBlock, a89-PurpleBlock, a128-PurpleBlock"
3,125.75,127.5,oh that's the heaviest,that,"a5-PurpleBlock, a129-PurpleBlock"
2,128.54,129.82,oh this seems to heavy,this,"a6-YellowBlock, a130-YellowBlock"
1,136.92,138.42,think it should be,it,
3,139.87,142.15,yeah they should be twenty as well,they,
3,147.5,149.0,should i put this as twenty,this,
1,149.74,150.25,green,green,"a9-GreenBlock, a133-GreenBlock"
1,152.57,153.59,now it's forty,it,
1,155.75,156.25,this is,this,a10-PurpleBlock
1,159.06,160.01,no no no that's silly,that,
2,160.86,161.59,i think that's heavier,that,a12-Yellowblock
1,162.17,163.67,this one or this one,"this, this",a13-PurpleBlock
2,163.58,164.92,eh that one is lighter yeah,that,
3,179.32,181.84,yeah i think it's yeah thirty,it,
2,207.51,211.07,so it's not exactly aligning but it could be,"it, it",
2,227.54,229.59,fifty and the purple is,purple,
3,236.42,244.67,fifty oh purple is thirty yellow,"purple, yellow",a23-RedBlock
1,239.45,242.67,i'm sorry it purple is thirty,"purple, it",
2,243.0,246.17,uh it's not exactly aligning should i,it,
2,246.75,251.0,so this seem it's little more yeah so should i put something here,"this, it",
1,250.0,252.09,do you want to put ten it is,it,"a93-BlueBlock, a140-BlueBlock"
3,252.81,254.33,we can try it yeah,it,
2,260.24,262.17,but then that'll even this is,"that, this",a141-None
2,263.17,264.67,this is ten ok we know that this is ten,"this, that, this",
3,265.14,273.75,yeah no it's still on the left,it,
2,267.67,270.0,yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out,"that, they",
1,269.75,272.25,now it's completely now,it,
3,276.75,277.5,you mean like this,this,"a25-BlueBlock, a142-BlueBlock"
2,279.04,281.05,so this is thirty oops sorry,this,
1,300.75,304.0,it's okay or we should just us scale it with this one,"it, it, this",a94-GreenBlock
1,313.42,316.42,it's it's two gram i think,"it, it",
1,316.67,318.92,it has until five but,it,
3,323.17,325.75,yeah it's i don't know,it,"a28-RedBlock, a95-PurpleBlock"
2,323.5,324.56,what does this do,this,
1,326.75,328.5,it's five gram now,it,
1,328.84,334.82,it's mmm it's this way plus five so you can,"it, it, this","a29-PurpleBlock, a144-PurpleBlock"
3,340.08,341.85,oh ok so it could be,it,
3,358.33,363.17,so if you move it there then we're adding like five grams yeah to that one,"it, that",
1,360.42,362.57,going to this one yeah,this,
2,363.42,369.92,no so it's divided it's two point five and two point five so it can't be other five that's not how it works,"it, it, it, that, it",
3,372.58,375.42,so is it to the right right now like the scale,it,
3,378.21,381.52,like the center scale is it to the right okay so,it,
1,381.25,383.56,but it doesn't have any,it,
1,394.03,397.25,ah yeah because yeah so it's fifty,it,
3,403.33,406.84,so if it's an interval of ten it should be forty but,"it, it",
3,408.33,411.34,it's more balanced with fifty grams,it,
3,429.0,432.0,otherwise uh like it wasn't balanced with,it,
1,431.52,432.33,it's slightly off,it,
2,433.33,435.05,it's slightly to the left that's what it,"it, that, it",
2,441.41,444.42,it could be forty but can we measure forty,it,
3,445.5,448.5,so so green,green,
2,445.67,449.42,so that is thirty plus ten so that is purple,"purple, that, that","a33-BlueBlock, a34-RedBlock"
2,450.5,452.75,purple plus red i guess,"purple, red",a35-BlueBlock
2,457.21,458.84,no okay i think it's fifty,it,
3,469.42,476.25,yeah i think so so red ten yeah,red,a97-GreenBlock
2,470.13,477.0,that is correct yellow is fifty purple was thirty blue is ten,"yellow, purple, blue, that",
3,491.91,492.67,green was,green,a98-Greenblock
3,494.42,496.14,twenty and purple was thirty,purple,"a42-PurpleBlock, a150-PurpleBlock"
2,530.0,533.5,maybe um maybe first you can try don't say it aloud,it,
2,534.15,537.66,you can try it don't say it aloud so that we don't biased,"it, it, that",a43-MysteryBlock
2,543.21,546.0,should we turn or something so that we don't biased,that,"a44-MysteryBlock, a99-PurpleBlock"
2,558.08,561.25,so is it also in like multiples of ten the weight,it,a45-RedBlock
3,594.91,610.14,i don't know like could somebody else like try ok i can yeah i think we have like two attempts to tell it to you yeah,it,"a56-RedBlock, a57-MysteryBlock, a103-BlueBlock, a104-YellowBlock"
2,600.75,602.82,ok you both try not to look so that,that,
3,611.32,613.92,okay so like we can discuss it amongst ourselves,it,a58-MysteryBlock
3,615.38,618.67,like we have to input it here so there will be like two tries,it,a105-YellowBlock
3,621.0,630.5,yes no no we can like talk about it amongst ourselves we just have like two tries to like fill it in,"it, it","a60-YellowBlock, a107-MysteryBlock"
1,622.0,624.0,so it's this last try,"it, this","a59-YellowBlock, a106-MysteryBlock"
2,644.41,646.5,yellow is fifty right,yellow,a64-YellowBlock
2,666.16,668.75,i think this is seventy,this,"a69-MysteryBlock, a111-YellowBlock"
3,670.25,674.75,do you want to like it felt more heavier to me i don'­t know,it,
3,676.58,679.09,yeah like i tried it with all the blocks,it,
2,679.11,683.56,maybe um picking like this might also help,this,"a70-YellowBlock, a112-MysteryBlock"
1,687.11,689.92,what about put it on one finger,it,
2,694.66,698.12,it's like difficult i'll have to place it for you maybe,"it, it",a71-YellowBlock
3,709.41,712.66,okay uh purple was heavier than green,"purple, green","a75-BlueBlock, a125-PurpleBlock"
1,714.94,717.25,i think they are equal yeah,they,a76-GreenBlock
2,716.66,717.42,now it's equal,it,
2,719.0,722.66,so this is uh thirty plus purple is,"purple, this",
3,722.25,723.75,uh yellow was fifty,yellow,
3,726.5,729.0,and this was twenty and this was thirty,"this, this",a122-MysteryBlock
2,731.83,740.16,so this is eighty okay so what do you think how did you hold it,"this, it",
3,733.03,741.16,yeah i think i thought like even all of these combined were like this,"these, this","a77-YellowBlock, a78-BlueBlock, a113-MysteryBlock"
2,741.92,743.75,like that like on three fingers,that,
3,750.5,752.5,yeah like this seems more,this,
2,752.75,758.83,one two three fingers i guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with i don't know,it,"a79-YellowBlock, a114-MysteryBlock"
2,766.16,767.42,oh maybe i'll try holding it here,it,a115-MysteryBlock
2,773.25,774.5,it kinda feels the same,it,a82-YellowBlock
2,775.0,778.75,can you put it on my these two fingers,"it, these",a83-YellowBlock
2,805.09,817.33,it's very difficult i don'­t know what side it is like if you pick it up like this so this is why i felt it is seventy is because i was holding it like this,"it, it, it, this, this, it, it, this","a88-PurpleBlock, a151-BlueBlock, a152-YellowBlock, a206-MysteryBlock"
1,806.59,812.33,because it's not just when we weighed it's not just the weight it's could be,"it, it, it","a86-YellowBlock, a87-MysteryBlock, a116-BlueBlock"
2,817.67,821.16,but now it does feel heavier actually now that you mention it,"it, that, it","a153-MysteryBlock, a207-YellowBlock"
1,824.5,829.84,so how about those two i had eh these two,"those, these","a154-MysteryBlock, a155-BlueBlock, a156-GreenBlock, a157-PurpleBlock, a208-YellowBlock"
3,829.05,832.0,uh green was twenty this is thirty this is fifty,"green, this, this","a158-GreenBlock, a159-PurpleBlock"
2,843.87,846.41,is there a better way to measure it,it,a164-GreenBlock
3,847.39,853.16,like if we were just measuring like one block we could just drop it to the ground the heavier one would fall first,it,
1,854.33,856.58,or juggling like this,this,a165-MysteryBlock
2,869.42,873.5,no i said seventy but now it could be more i don'­t know,it,a166-MysteryBlock
1,869.66,871.0,i think it should be,it,
2,874.25,880.54,actually feel this is equal to the combined weight of all of this now is there,"this, this","a167-YellowBlock, a213-MysteryBlock"
3,886.33,890.09,like it's generally this one,"it, this",
2,897.25,899.02,this feels very heavy okay,this,
3,901.25,904.75,how about you hold this in one hand and what we'll do is like,this,a169-MysteryBlock
3,914.41,925.16,so what if you like put this in one hand and we like had move like one block from like the other hand to this hand and see if whether it becomes heavier or lighter,"this, this, it","a172-MysteryBlock, a173-YellowBlock"
3,933.5,939.33,so yeah i'll put this here,this,"a175-YellowBlock, a215-MysteryBlock, a230-BlueBlock"
2,943.68,948.66,so if there was a way to hold it like this i think this is more sensitive,"it, this, this","a176-YellowBlock, a216-MysteryBlock"
2,950.94,952.93,this is definitely heavier i feel like,this,"a177-BlueBlock, a217-YellowBlock"
1,958.09,977.5,i forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that sorry uh no no the name of that in the physic perhaps i can see the,"that, that, that","a178-GreenBlock, a218-YellowBlock, a219-YellowBlock, a231-MysteryBlock"
1,980.85,984.61,at least i want to see a word no it's okay,it,"a180-MysteryBlock, a221-YellowBlock"
2,995.5,997.54,it could be the same can you try it now or,"it, it","a183-YellowBlock, a223-MysteryBlock"
3,1014.45,1017.72,yeah now like this is heavier yeah,this,"a235-PurpleBlock, a236-PurpleBlock"
2,1023.78,1032.59,i think we should try very fast so that you become more aware before you get used to it then how about this,"that, it, this","a184-YellowBlock, a224-MysteryBlock, a239-GreenBlock, a240-BlueBlock"
3,1035.92,1040.61,i think good yard uh yeah this one,this,"a241-GreenBlock, a259-RedBlock, a265-BlueBlock"
3,1041.46,1043.14,so this seems similar as well,this,
3,1048.48,1055.37,yeah so like when you add like the red and blue i don't think it makes that much of a difference but,"red, blue, it, that",
2,1055.79,1057.98,so it's definitely this much,"it, this",
3,1057.33,1062.09,but it could be this much or like with like,"it, this",
2,1062.11,1070.82,like plus or minus do you want to try that so hold it like that because it's more sensitive,"that, it, that, it",a242-RedBlock
3,1063.59,1067.21,yeah yeah yeah like they're so,they,
3,1087.23,1091.23,yeah try to hold it like a bit higher i think like yeah,it,"a185-YellowBlock, a225-MysteryBlock, a248-RedBlock"
1,1098.0,1099.59,this just fits me,this,"a250-RedBlock, a261-PurpleBlock"
1,1106.1,1106.79,it's heavier,it,a262-BlueBlock
1,1111.67,1118.21,i think all of them yeah i think it's between these two,"them, it, these","a251-RedBlock, a252-RedBlock, a263-BlueBlock, a264-BlueBlock"
2,1113.54,1115.94,is it the same or now what do you feel,it,
2,1118.73,1119.82,between these two,these,
1,1119.42,1122.47,yeah because when you put could you put that on,that,
1,1123.98,1127.97,when you put yeah when you put this one its heavier,this,
3,1128.34,1132.67,uh the red one oh yeah uh no okay so it's like either all of these or with blue,"red, blue, it, these",
1,1129.68,1135.99,the blue the blue now it's they are they feel same,"blue, blue, it, they, they",a253-BlueBlock
1,1140.04,1144.92,yeah do you want to try that i just want to make sure,that,
1,1148.0,1155.31,we can start with the smaller one we can put on the smaller because it is because it is,"it, it","a186-MysteryBlock, a187-BlueBlock, a226-RedBlock, a254-GreenBlock, a255-PurpleBlock"
2,1155.61,1159.24,we have this can we utilize this paper somehow,"this, this","a188-GreenBlock, a256-YellowBlock"
3,1167.34,1170.23,or like but where it'­s somehow,it,a190-MysteryBlock
1,1178.85,1181.37,you should take it like this,"it, this",
3,1179.89,1181.61,yeah hold it like this yeah,"it, this",
1,1198.72,1200.71,yeah it's it's uh yeah i think we need more,"it, it",
3,1197.0,1200.93,okay what does it more,it,a192-GreenBlock
2,1216.73,1219.23,am i holding it right in the center i hope,it,a196-BlueBlock
1,1223.56,1227.0,i don'­t know why but because maybe it's very,it,
1,1232.92,1235.53,because we need to put them on each other,them,a197-GreenBlock
3,1239.72,1248.21,could you like make it more like no no uh more yeah go right there like yeah like that,"it, that",a228-RedBlock
2,1241.75,1244.45,like this like this,"this, this",
3,1249.32,1252.34,so where is oh yellow is,yellow,a198-YellowBlock
3,1261.61,1263.72,i think it's slanted this way,"it, this",a201-BlueBlock
2,1266.82,1268.98,is it is it because i'm holding it incorrect,"it, it, it",
3,1269.01,1271.74,i think so can i try holding it yeah,it,a258-GreenBlock
2,1274.5,1276.66,if we had like a string that could,that,
3,1277.0,1279.0,how about try doing it now,it,
2,1279.12,1281.09,okay so we definitely know that this is,"that, this",
3,1281.59,1283.87,uh this is the mystery block yes,"mystery, this",a203-MysteryBlock
3,1289.18,1299.25,yeah so uh yeah how about you add it first and then i'll pick it up and see how heavy,"it, it","a204-PurpleBlock, a205-PurpleBlock"
1,1290.48,1291.74,it sounds like,it,
2,1293.27,1300.84,you should be holding this we definitely know that it's,"this, that, it","a267-YellowBlock, a274-GreenBlock"
3,1304.0,1305.28,so the biggest one is yellow,yellow,
2,1309.99,1317.76,it's not exactly clear it's not a good method i think it's not a good method,"it, it, it",
1,1319.58,1325.28,what about that one but we start from a smaller one we should try that,"that, that","a268-RedBlock, a275-MysteryBlock"
1,1326.0,1330.56,yeah you um just keep them but from the small one,them,"a269-RedBlock, a276-BlueBlock"
3,1335.26,1338.84,yeah like you hold it the same way but we start with like the smallest,it,"a270-MysteryBlock, a277-RedBlock, a279-BlueBlock"
3,1343.02,1346.0,how does it feel right now okay,it,"a278-RedBlock, a280-YellowBlock"
3,1358.34,1360.59,i think that would be heavier now,that,
2,1362.34,1365.94,i think it's the same around the same,it,
3,1365.93,1370.95,okay how about uh no no uh could you put the blue one back yeah,blue,"a283-GreenBlock, a285-PurpleBlock, a288-BlueBlock"
3,1371.5,1374.67,uh and we'll like remove one of them,them,
2,1378.36,1381.36,yeah this is heavier now the right side,this,
3,1379.86,1380.61,this is heavier now,this,
1,1383.63,1386.13,what was the weight of that,that,
3,1385.92,1387.17,i think this was twenty,this,
3,1389.97,1392.73,let's uh change this,this,"a286-PurpleBlock, a289-YellowBlock"
3,1401.0,1402.34,this is okay,this,a271-MysteryBlock
2,1423.47,1424.59,this is heavier right side i think,this,
2,1427.54,1429.63,now you try because i'm getting used to it,it,"a273-MysteryBlock, a284-PurpleBlock, a356-GreenBlock"
3,1444.42,1445.92,this is heavier the right side,this,a343-YellowBlock
2,1450.86,1457.59,you can always uh like your right hand side you can always put it down and pick it up again because you might get used to it,"it, it, it","a292-MysteryBlock, a320-RedBlock, a344-GreenBlock"
2,1462.68,1466.13,sort of can you put down the right side and pick it up again,it,
3,1469.83,1472.11,yeah no this is heavy yeah,this,a293-MysteryBlock
2,1473.0,1479.79,okay stop stop because i felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier so we neeed to,"that, that, this",
3,1477.57,1484.11,yeah no uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks,"it, it, this",a294-PurpleBlock
2,1485.09,1490.38,these four you mean was it so it means,"these, it, it",
3,1486.36,1494.38,uh yeah these four blocks not the green one yeah so it's between like these two,"green, these, it, these",
3,1494.82,1507.39,how about you try uh like try it with this one since we know like that this is the heaviest that we know of we put some random ones uh,"it, this, that, this, that","a295-PurpleBlock, a321-GreenBlock, a345-YellowBlock, a346-YellowBlock, a357-MysteryBlock, a365-RedBlock"
2,1515.42,1516.13,this feels heavier,this,
1,1518.79,1521.31,really but it wasn't,it,"a296-MysteryBlock, a297-MysteryBlock, a322-YellowBlock, a347-PurpleBlock"
2,1526.79,1527.28,it feel the same,it,"a299-MysteryBlock, a323-YellowBlock"
3,1532.59,1535.07,this one which one feels similar,this,"a300-YellowBlock, a301-YellowBlock, a324-MysteryBlock, a325-MysteryBlock"
1,1538.66,1542.09,i think we should callibrate for example these,these,"a303-MysteryBlock, a327-YellowBlock, a358-PurpleBlock"
1,1548.27,1555.57,no we should callibrate like this and we put other thing and we remove one thing,this,"a305-YellowBlock, a306-YellowBlock, a329-MysteryBlock, a330-MysteryBlock, a348-GreenBlock, a366-BlueBlock"
3,1556.0,1572.98,yeah i think that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that,"that, that","a308-BlueBlock, a333-RedBlock, a359-BlueBlock, a367-RedBlock"
1,1563.66,1570.52,and we add and we don'­t say to you that what we add or we and finally we find,that,"a307-MysteryBlock, a331-GreenBlock, a332-GreenBlock"
2,1572.67,1576.75,these are equal this is thirty and this,"these, this, this",
1,1574.56,1577.75,and we just um mix this together,this,
3,1577.27,1581.5,that is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty,"that, this, this","a309-YellowBlock, a334-PurpleBlock"
2,1579.34,1579.84,oh this is fifty,this,
1,1587.92,1596.0,no no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal okay take these two,"these, they, these","a310-MysteryBlock, a311-GreenBlock, a312-BlueBlock, a335-PurpleBlock, a336-RedBlock, a349-YellowBlock"
1,1609.83,1614.19,so you should feel those at first that they are,"those, that, they","a313-BlueBlock, a337-RedBlock, a351-GreenBlock, a352-YellowBlock, a361-BlueBlock"
2,1620.49,1621.46,this is heavier,this,
2,1631.33,1631.83,this is heavier,this,"a354-PurpleBlock, a364-MysteryBlock"
2,1643.16,1643.61,this is heavier,this,
3,1654.0,1659.84,okay i okay could you like put them down yeah,them,
1,1660.09,1664.33,it doesn'­t feel correct,it,a314-GreenBlock
2,1667.92,1681.0,so that but this is equal this is fifty ten sixty sixty plus six so this is ninety,"that, this, this, this","a316-YellowBlock, a317-PurpleBlock"
3,1670.56,1678.39,so if like these feel similar so fifty thirty,these,a338-YellowBlock
2,1681.59,1687.59,and this is thirty ninety minus thirty sixty,this,a318-BlueBlock
3,1692.19,1693.46,uh this one was fifty,this,a319-YellowBlock
2,1694.49,1695.18,you're sure about that right,that,a339-RedBlock
1,1706.0,1707.0,i should feel like this,this,a368-RedBlock
1,1723.75,1724.0,this one,this,a392-GreenBlock
2,1727.28,1729.0,this was in the same group right,this,a395-MysteryBlock
1,1733.33,1736.11,it's heavier it's this one,"it, it, this","a369-Redblock, a386-BlueBlock, a393-GreenBlock"
1,1737.48,1737.67,this one,this,
3,1737.87,1744.33,your left hand yeah ok this is heavier ok uh,this,
2,1740.69,1741.19,it's heavier,it,
3,1767.41,1773.0,okay okay uh you can put them down so we have like this is twenty,"them, this",
2,1770.87,1771.75,this is how much,this,
3,1778.64,1786.41,so uh this is the nah i think i'm good yeah we've got like uh,this,
2,1780.94,1792.67,do you do you want to try it again so this is uh either sixty or or eighty right,"it, this","a370-GreenBlock, a371-PurpleBlock"
2,1802.59,1805.0,because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty,"this, that, it",
3,1802.63,1808.42,i think so yeah fifty thirty isn't this a hundred,this,a373-MysteryBlock
3,1819.97,1822.68,this was one block that shadi tried right,"this, that",a375-BlueBloc
2,1824.0,1824.79,do you feel it's the same,it,a387-BlueBlock
1,1824.5,1825.68,it's eighty,it,"a376-PurpleBlock, a388-BlueBlock"
2,1835.1,1838.47,so either a hundred or sixty but that's too steep a jump,that,"a377-PurpleBlock, a378-YellowBlock"
1,1910.87,1912.67,it should be something like,it,
2,1913.67,1915.09,the second mystery block,mystery,
3,1915.67,1923.42,does this not seem like the fibonacci sequence like one one two three five eight and then one thirty,this,
2,1938.17,1940.92,so that should be eight plus five so thirteen,that,
3,1944.92,1950.18,i like yeah like it seems the obvious pattern,it,
1,1960.84,1970.84,actually we can't have forty because we have this one we can't have sixty we have this seventy we have these two eighty,"this, this, these",
1,1971.78,1974.09,but we can't oh yeah it's it's fibonacci,"it, it",
1,2019.89,2023.84,maybe we should guess the weight of that with fibonacci as well,that,
2,2025.0,2026.5,yeah that was one thirty so it'll be,"that, it",
1,2026.47,2029.47,no i mean this one based on the other,this,
3,2027.5,2033.5,this one yeah so one one two three five and then three plus five is eight,this,
2,2052.08,2057.25,we placed the in the correct position so it was easy to see that they fit into the fibonacci series,"it, that, they",
3,2057.42,2060.24,yeah i think that is fine,that,
