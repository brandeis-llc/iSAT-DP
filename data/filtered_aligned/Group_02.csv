2,27.15,28.38,can we use this piece of paper,this,
1,81.33,85.53,yeah it's like a bit slow to level up,it,
1,86.82,88.95,so i would imagine if this,this,
1,88.98,91.58,needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal,"red, that, they",
2,92.58,94.65,and i i think they are,they,
2,94.77,97.05,especially since it keeps going back in a,it,
1,97.11,102.39,yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know,"they, they","a3-BlueBlock, a64-Block"
1,104.08,106.23,so that one is probably ten grams too,that,"a4-YellowBlock, a65-YellowBlock"
1,108.06,111.3,and then if that's ten grams then we have a two,that,a5-BlueBlock
2,112.29,117.87,so i'm going to hold back on that one because i think it's the heaviest,"that, it","a6-YellowBlock, a66-YellowBlock"
2,120.5,121.59,the green one,green,"a7-GreenBlock, a196-GreenBlock"
2,124.68,127.02,and that looks like it might be about even,"that, it",
1,138.0,140.31,there we go that's better,that,
2,141.27,146.91,well on the first go through i noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then,it,
1,144.92,149.08,yeah so that's probably twenty grams,that,"a8-GreenBlock, a68-GreenBlock"
2,158.13,164.17,so knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah,"green, that",a11-GreenBlock
3,167.13,169.11,this is what we are looking at next,this,"a12-PurpleBlock, a70-PurpleBlock"
2,195.93,199.5,yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks,"it, it",
1,199.75,200.82,oh yeah it does,it,
1,216.87,220.01,i guess it's leveling out a bit more but,it,
2,221.4,225.41,i guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on that,that,
1,233.61,236.49,putting this on that side checking this one,"this, that, this","a17-PurpleBlock, a18-YellowBlock, a73-PurpleBlock, a74-YellowBlock"
2,247.95,250.17,so that's the twenty and the thirty,that,
2,255.36,258.01,it's leaning towards one side a bit much,it,"a20-GreenBlock, a76-GreenBlock"
1,258.08,260.67,yeah we could probably try it with just ten,it,a21-BlueBlock
1,288.12,290.1,wait did we mix these up or,these,a26-PurpleBlock
3,293.66,294.75,so these are both ten,these,
3,297.06,297.75,blue or purple,"blue, purple",
1,300.51,302.82,i think purple or,purple,a29-BlueBlock
2,303.75,309.48,this would be blue this would be purple yeah i thought they were both blue until,"blue, purple, blue, this, this, they",
1,303.15,307.25,blue yeah no i see that's like a navy blue,"blue, blue, that",
2,343.98,346.75,wait a mystery block,mystery,
2,381.48,384.42,ok so this block is heavier than our fifty,this,"a33-MysteryBlock, a34-MysteryBlock, a54-GreenBlock"
1,419.43,421.68,yeah i mean that seems pretty similar,that,"a48-PurpleBlock, a192-YellowBlock"
1,429.78,430.58,that also seems similar,that,a90-RedBlock
2,432.08,433.47,do you want to give it a shot,it,
3,443.04,445.71,like all of these,these,"a94-YellowBlock, a95-RedBlock, a148-PurpleBlock"
2,456.42,458.4,all of these together is going to be,these,
1,468.66,470.55,yeah cause that's,that,a100-MysteryBlock
1,490.2,492.18,so it's probably,it,a108-MysteryBlock
1,495.0,498.57,i think it's a bit more than the max,it,a109-MysteryBlock
1,522.0,530.37,i don't know that's kind of my thought process um,that,
3,527.5,528.95,is it one fifty on here,it,
2,543.33,546.12,sorry one fifty since it's on there,it,"a116-MysteryBlock, a117-BlueBlock, a152-RedBlock"
1,555.15,557.19,is it wrong,it,
1,580.53,583.02,i don't know it's probably better if the same hand,it,"a122-GreenBlock, a190-MysteryBlock, a155-PurpleBlock, a199-MysteryBlock"
3,595.0,597.51,wait what it it again when it's lined up,"it, it, it",a126-BlueBlock
2,598.75,602.55,that's a ten ten that's a twenty,"that, that","a128-Greenblock, a129-YellowBlock"
1,597.9,599.5,um think yeah these are ten,these,a127-RedBlock
2,602.91,604.98,fifty and that's a thirty,that,
2,607.98,612.63,and we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or,this,a131-MysteryBlock
2,616.02,618.0,together that's one twenty,that,
3,623.01,624.9,i think it has to do with patterns,it,"a134-BlueBlock, a135-RedBlock"
3,625.26,629.07,because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks,it,
3,637.71,639.99,these add up to twenty,these,
3,640.29,642.9,these add up to thirty these add up to fifty,"these, these",a139-YellowBlock
3,644.79,647.37,but that doesn't really make sense either i don't know,that,
1,647.49,649.47,yeah i mean this could be,this,
1,649.98,655.71,this set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that,"this, this, that",
2,655.86,661.77,so these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty,these,
3,656.5,658.58,so it would be eighty and you weigh less,it,
3,673.68,676.8,i think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty,"it, it",
3,677.25,680.28,i think it just feels like it's,"it, it",a140-MysteryBlock
3,680.52,684.83,a lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that,"it, that",a141-YellowBlock
1,682.33,683.66,yeah that might makes sense,that,
3,686.58,689.04,no you're wrong it was eighty,it,
1,689.58,671.17,yeah it's a pattern,it,
3,697.5,700.29,is is the yeah mystery block,mystery,a143-MysteryBlock
3,726.81,730.89,well that was our one thirty right because that was fifty,"that, that",
1,733.56,737.28,that makes sense yeah fifty and eighty one thirty,that,
1,765.96,772.68,i guess heaviest to least heaviest maybe because these two add up to that one,"these, that",
1,772.95,775.05,these two add up to that one,"these, that",
1,775.65,781.08,these two i guess it doesn't matter which order it's just the sum of the previous two,"these, it, it",
