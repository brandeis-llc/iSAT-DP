3,58.33,58.84,it's right there,it,
3,70.51,70.01,um it's turned off,it,
1,78.08,80.58,ok well it would be nine minus ten,it,"a2-RedBlock, a206-RedBlock"
2,80.58,84.3,that's ten so then,that,"a3-BlueBlock, a207-BlueBlock"
1,86.07,87.41,just like put it on,it,
3,95.19,97.17,it seems pretty balanced,it,
1,97.56,102.03,yeah ok so now we know that this is also ten,"that, this","a4-BlueBlock, a208-BlueBlock"
1,106.23,110.01,what would we maybe put that one on there too,that,"a5-PurpleBlock, a6-BlueBlock, a209-PurpleBlock"
2,112.16,112.92,it's more,it,
1,114.87,120.33,lets try this one oh gee louise this one,"this, this","a7-PurpleBlock, a8-YellowBlock, a9-YellowBlock, a10-GreenBlock, a210-PurpleBlock, a25-None, a26-None, a211-GreenBlock"
2,127.35,132.0,ok so this one is probably twenty ten ten twenty,this,
1,132.27,139.65,ok so now lets start at thirty alright put one of those on there,those,"a11-GreenBlock, a12-RedBlock, a13-GreenBlock, a14-PurpleBlock, a29-GreenBlock, a212-PurpleBlock"
2,142.91,144.92,probably thirty at this point,this,
1,148.86,159.42,ok so we got ok yeah this one is really heavy so lets do the a this and a ten,"this, this","a15-PurpleBlock, a16-YellowBlock, a17-GreenBlock, a31-PurpleBlock, a33-BlueBlock"
1,169.31,171.99,interesting so that's ten twenty,that,
1,172.56,183.58,so we said this ones thirty i still feel like that's heavier and this one is twenty,"this, that, this",
2,174.54,185.08,yeah yeah the blue dark blue one is thirty that's the larger one it's slightly heavier yeah,"blue, blue, that, it",a20-GreenBlock
3,185.33,187.83,we can replace one of these with the twenty to get,these,
1,189.91,196.44,ok and then put that on that one,"that, that","a36-BlueBlock, a37-BlueBlock, a228-BlueBlock, a229-GreenBlock, a49-BlueBlock, a58-GreenBlock"
2,198.15,202.14,how much is the dark blue small one ten,blue,
1,200.31,201.37,ten they're both,they,
1,203.49,204.34,assuming that this was,"that, this",
2,204.58,206.37,oh gosh i think i got them mixed up,them,
1,207.06,210.87,yeah im thinking that it's ten ten twenty thirty,"that, it",
2,216.16,217.66,it's just like slightly,it,
1,228.06,231.51,and now it stopped being too heavy,it,
1,231.54,233.52,so this is supposedly,this,
1,234.27,239.82,thirty fourty fifty correct and it's still heavier than this thing,"it, this",
1,251.88,258.72,so thirty this is also forty right so this if forty yeah,"this, this","a43-PurpleBlock, a61-GreenBlock, a62-BlueBlock"
2,254.63,255.31,ok so that one's twenty right,that,
1,260.01,263.82,this is fifty it's not,"this, it","a44-GreenBlock, a54-GreenBlock"
1,264.93,267.36,yo that's close enough ok so,that,
3,268.08,272.58,yeah fifty so we say yellow is fifty,yellow,"a45-YellowBlock, a46-PurpleBlock, a55-YellowBlock, a56-PurpleBlock"
3,274.26,280.32,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,"green, blue, purple",
1,275.83,277.75,i think that's i think that's good,"that, that",
2,281.25,283.48,i think this one is purple and this one is blue,"purple, blue, this, this",
3,282.25,286.26,ok so blue is ten and purple is,"blue, purple",a214-BlueBlock
1,288.92,292.47,yes verify real quick but i think it is,it,"a215-PurpleBlock, a47-GreenBlock, a65-PurpleBlock, a57-None, a119-PurpleBlock, a64-RedBlock"
1,295.32,304.62,yeah we got them yeah,them,"a66-PurpleBlock, a67-GreenBlock, a120-PurpleBlock, a121-None, a122-RedBlock"
1,304.68,305.58,that looks good to me,that,
1,308.28,312.3,uh blue yeah so you said purple sweet,"blue, purple",
2,312.93,315.42,purple is thirty red is twenty yellow is fifty,"purple, red, yellow",
1,342.06,347.07,yeah cause if you feel the yellow one oh yeah so yeah,yellow,"a69-MysteryBlock, a230-YellowBlock, a231-YellowBlock"
1,354.36,359.76,ok so we got this ok,this,"a72-MysteryBlock, a73-PurpleBlock, a232-YellowBlock"
1,361.23,365.07,ooh that seems pretty good pretty close to me,that,"a74-MysteryBlock, a123-YellowBlock"
2,365.49,367.98,how much was purple thirty,purple,"a75-MysteryBlock, a76-MysteryBlock, a124-YellowBlock, a125-YellowBlock"
2,368.7,369.42,purple was thirty,purple,
2,370.86,372.84,and yellow was fifty,yellow,"a77-YellowBlock, a78-MysteryBlock"
1,373.89,380.58,yeah try picking these two up and you can close your eyes and try to hold it from the,"these, it","a79-MysteryBlock, a80-MysteryBlock, a127-YellowBlock, a128-YellowBlock"
3,385.08,388.41,i almost feel like this one is still heavier,this,"a81-MysteryBlock, a129-YellowBlock"
2,394.62,399.66,this one feels heavier still add like ten to this side i think,"this, this","a83-MysteryBlock, a84-BlueBlock, a131-YellowBlock"
2,402.81,406.89,it still feels heavier but it could just be,"it, it","a85-MsyteryBlock, a132-YellowBlock"
3,407.58,410.37,it is definitely denser which could be skewing,it,"a86-MysteryBlock, a87-MysteryBlock, a133-YellowBlock"
3,410.52,412.5,our perception of it,it,a88-YellowBlock
2,413.43,414.58,so right now that's ninety grams,that,a90-YellowBlock
1,416.76,420.03,and na that's freaking that's way,"that, that","a91-MysteryBlock, a92-RedBlock, a136-YellowBlock, a137-BlueBlock, a168-GreenBlock"
2,420.96,423.39,that's a hundred,that,"a93-MysteryBlock, a138-YellowBlock"
1,423.87,430.47,yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,"that, it","a94-MysteryBlock, a95-MysteryBlock, a139-YellowBlock, a140-YellowBlock"
2,432.66,435.72,that does feel pretty similar give it a shot,"that, it","a97-MysteryBlock, a142-YellowBlock"
3,442.68,448.16,it feels really similar and that's a hundred grams,"it, that",
1,443.66,454.47,yeah that's a good first guess and we get two so do you think we should a consensus on that one and this is fifty,"that, that, this",a99-MysteryBlock
2,448.91,450.5,let's do it yeah a hundred i think,it,
1,460.26,464.28,uh yeah so should we press the blue arrow,blue,"a218-RedBlock, a233-BlueBlock"
3,464.64,473.25,we're on this screen right now should we go onto the next one ok,this,
1,467.91,473.25,the current weight of the last that was our first test ok,that,
3,473.37,479.88,two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,"it, it",
1,481.71,485.94,that was not quite correct ok,that,
3,487.11,489.69,i think it's more if it's anything,"it, it","a101-YellowBlock, a102-GreenBlock"
3,491.07,493.59,that's less right now,that,a219-BlueBlock
2,493.72,495.42,is that less right now oh,that,
1,495.72,498.01,oh yeah that is where we were at,that,"a104-BlueBlock, a234-RedBlock"
2,498.5,521.25,we were at this yet ok,this,"a105-YellowBlock, a106-MysteryBlock, a107-MysteryBlock, a108-MysteryBlock, a109-MysteryBlock, a110-YellowBlock, a235-RedBlock, a148-YellowBlock, a149-YellowBlock"
3,500.16,502.83,no that's a hundred and ten,that,
1,505.68,511.29,the thing that sucks is that now we are finding about like torque and different other,"that, that",
2,517.02,519.24,i still think the brown one is heavier than this,"brown, this",
2,525.0,526.13,it's hard to balance them,"it, them",
1,533.01,537.3,i wonder like i don't know what that one,that,"a221-MysteryBlock, a114-MysteryBlock, a115-YellowBlock, a237-YellowBlock"
1,541.74,545.94,so i think definitely it's either,it,
1,546.21,554.52,this or this cause we can't even make these weights so it could be above them i know but like if we are thinking it's so close to a hundred,"this, this, these, it, them, it",
3,549.41,550.5,that could be part of it,"that, it",
1,555.57,559.58,are probably errors within yeah within this,this,a222-YellowBlock
2,562.08,563.41,no that doesn't do anything,that,a238-RedBlock
2,565.59,574.71,i would say either a hundred twenty or a hundred thirty because i feel like it would be possible for it to be out of range of what we can measure but,"it, it","a223-YellwoBlock, a224-RedBlock, a117-BlueBlock, a118-YellowBlock, a239-GreenBlock"
1,578.88,582.09,yeah it's just weird,it,"a226-MysteryBlock, a227-BlueBlock, a241-YellowBlock, a242-RedBlock"
1,589.86,602.07,i don't know i guess i would i would vote one of these two but what do you guys think ok,these,"a249-YellowBlock, a262-MysteryBlock"
3,603.9,608.64,it feels close i just can't tell if like,it,"a250-YellowBlock, a263-MysteryBlock"
2,609.0,612.75,so right now this is one-twenty,this,
2,623.43,628.02,yeah it's either one twenty or one thirty for me so i think one twenty would be the best guess,it,
1,641.79,645.92,yeah there's it's gotta be something to do with the verticality of this but yeah we failed,"it, this",a252-YellowBlock
1,677.16,679.14,they didn't send us the next block,they,
1,679.23,686.61,so we ok let's see the second mystery block,mystery,
3,689.91,690.92,it's the fibonacci series,it,
1,694.98,697.29,that's twenty ok um,that,
3,704.75,706.25,yeah it's the fibonacci series,it,
1,729.69,731.79,it's f i b o,it,
1,732.75,739.02,and then n n or n a c c i yeah i need to resee it,it,
2,748.38,751.83,can't be like three other patterns that people can do,that,
1,754.77,757.89,um yeah let's i think that's fine,that,
1,760.41,771.36,it was wow ok we we got that one correct because of mister power work i don't know what i would have done at first to be honest,"it, that",
2,760.58,764.58,yeah that was a good thought,that,
2,752.25,774.39,yeah no i wouldn't have thought of that,that,
1,780.15,783.54,that's why you need three minds,that,
