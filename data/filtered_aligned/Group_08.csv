2,5.97,8.04,or is it,it,
2,8.07,11.55,yeah green is for twenty,green,
3,15.45,18.21,i'll just take these off and then we can have a little more,these,"a1-PurpleBlock, a59-RedBlock, a83-RedBlock, a104-PurpleBlock"
3,22.65,24.63,it's ok,it,
1,25.74,29.02,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe it might be thirty,"red, blue, it",
2,32.52,35.67,so twenty that's thirty,that,
3,42.6,47.75,i mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough they're just increments of ten grams,"that, it, it, they",
1,45.45,48.72,yeah so the blue one is thirty,blue,
2,48.78,51.75,blue is thirty big blue is thirty,"blue, blue",a105-PurpleBlock
3,51.87,54.33,so it's thirty here,it,"a4-PurpleBlock, a5-GreenBlock, a106-GreenBlock"
2,56.55,64.66,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,yellow,
1,58.58,64.86,did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one,yellow,
2,60.3,73.95,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,green,"a7-YellowBlock, a8-RedBlock, a9-RedBlock, a10-PurpleBlock, a11-RedBlock, a62-BlueBlock, a63-PurpleBlock, a64-GreenBlock, a84-BlueBlock, a107-YellowBlock, a108-GreenBlock"
1,74.07,76.05,oh that's too left,that,
1,76.41,78.45,try the red,red,a65-GreenBlock
1,78.51,80.61,keep that one,that,"a12-GreenBlock, a109-GreenBlock"
2,84.75,88.17,what if we do the green one and the two smaller cubes,green,
2,88.53,91.26,cause that's going to be pushing that way,"that, that",
3,91.53,92.76,gotcha are they centered,they,
1,93.62,95.79,this is twenty or thirty,this,a110-RedBlock
3,96.31,99.69,let's just make sure i guess they are centered,they,a13-RedBlock
2,96.06,96.75,yeah i feel that way,that,
3,98.25,99.25,these are ten,these,
2,100.05,106.25,green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said this one is thirty right,"green, green, green, this","a14-YellowBlock, a111-YellowBlock"
3,100.45,106.77,green is twenty ok green is twenty thirty yeah,"green, green","a15-YellowBlock, a16-GreenBlock, a66-GreenBlock, a112-YellowBlock, a113-GreenBlock"
2,119.76,126.39,that's too light and we know that green is equal to,"green, that, that","a18-RedBlock, a19-RedBlock, a67-RedBlock, a85-GreenBlock, a97-PurpleBlock"
2,126.42,128.4,this one and that one,"this, that",
2,128.94,131.25,so let's try this one too,this,"a20-RedBlock, a68-BlueBlock"
1,132.0,134.91,oh it's more than forty,it,"a21-BlueBlock, a69-RedBlock"
2,155.4,157.66,it's definitely not staying in between right,it,
1,157.58,159.33,yeah it's more than forty,it,
1,162.3,164.88,this is thirty this is twenty,"this, this","a24-PurpleBlock, a71-GreenBlock"
1,166.66,168.09,this is more than forty,this,a25-YellowBlock
3,198.15,203.75,i mean it could be just like how they were placed on like measured at like i don't know,"it, they",
1,197.1,198.92,yeah it is between forty and fifty,it,
1,206.07,212.19,we tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this,this,
2,209.82,211.22,so we can move one of these,these,
3,215.97,220.35,we know it's between forty and fifty we can't really,it,
3,225.06,227.49,directly compare it um,it,
1,227.73,231.03,actually just adding one gram made it equal,it,
2,234.93,237.9,oh yeah cause it's a scale yeah so,it,
1,237.93,239.33,so it's forty one,it,
2,248.55,251.25,where should we put it then in forty,it,
1,253.23,258.84,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure it accurately,"they, that, it",a31-GreenBlock
3,259.22,261.87,wait so is this just in the wrong place or is this the twenty,"this, this",
3,264.17,271.62,is this in the wrong place or is this ok so this is thirty fifty minus one so,"this, this, this",
1,263.01,272.73,shall we try that no it's twenty yeah one no not minus one minus nine,"that, it",
1,272.91,277.75,ok minus one it is yeah so it is forty nine,"it, it",
3,280.2,284.04,ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently,it,"a33-BlueBlock, a74-RedBlock, a102-None"
3,284.34,286.32,and callibrate it,it,
3,287.28,289.59,would you agree with that,that,"a34-PurpleBlock, a118-PurpleBlock"
3,310.2,312.5,should we double check anything or just assume that we got it,"that, it",
1,316.92,323.37,should we tenths length ok that's fine yeah,that,"a38-BlueBlock, a122-BlueBlock"
3,323.49,326.25,yeah we just got stumped cause it was like,it,"a39-PurpleBlock, a123-PurpleBlock"
2,340.06,348.0,so yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty,"yellow, yellow, yellow, green, they, it","a42-PurpleBlock, a43-PurpleBlock, a44-GreenBlock, a126-PurpleBlock, a127-PurpleBlock, a128-GreenBlock"
2,349.74,352.02,um purple is thirty,purple,
2,353.88,358.05,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,"blue, blue",
2,365.91,368.13,so red is ten blue is,"red, blue",
2,371.1,373.5,um green is twenty yep and then yellow,"green, yellow",
3,382.26,384.24,mystery block,mystery,
1,384.3,391.84,is there any mystery block third weight,mystery,
3,399.92,405.01,ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but,it,a45-MysteryBlock
1,402.01,405.57,it's like um,it,"a46-MysteryBlock, a76-PurpleBlock"
3,405.84,406.82,either that or we could just,that,
1,406.75,410.1,i think it's for data reference i don't know,it,a47-MysteryBlock
2,417.48,421.38,interesting i was definitely right yeah it's definitely,it,"a48-MysteryBlock, a77-YellowBlock"
2,425.1,428.34,i mean we could use a combination of these,these,"a49-YellowBlock, a50-YellowBlock"
3,442.74,450.81,um and if you notice they all have this kind of stuff written on them so maybe this is,"they, this, them, this","a51-GreenBlock, a78-MysteryBlock"
1,442.92,449.42,um yeah green is twenty yep let's check that,"green, that",a87-PurpleBllock
2,452.33,453.99,well they all say the same thing,they,"a52-PurpleBlock, a53-YellowBlock"
2,454.56,456.63,they all say,they,a54-GreenBlock
1,458.4,460.38,they all say the same thing actually,they,
2,460.62,464.37,so i don't think it matters um,it,
1,475.71,479.76,this has a forty now give me the thirty one,this,"a55-MysteryBlock, a80-YellowBlock, a92-PurpleBlock, a99-GreenBlock"
1,481.65,484.77,it is twenty one second,it,"a81-GreenBlock, a93-PurpleBlock, a100-GreenBlock"
1,485.07,487.05,yeah this is thirty,this,a56-PurpleBlock
1,489.6,491.58,it has a hole,it,a57-MysteryBlock
3,507.36,515.46,and do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable i don't know if that'll make a difference,"that, them, that, that","a58-MysteryBlock, a82-YellowBlock"
2,525.21,527.64,want me to add the green,green,
1,525.21,527.64,it's that yeah,"it, that","a95-BlueBlock, a101-PurpleBlock"
1,527.76,529.74,try that,that,a96-GreenBlock
1,532.65,536.04,and that just a little bit try that,"that, that",a171-YellowBlock
2,587.34,589.8,that feels more like it i'm going to be honest,"that, it","a129-YellowBlock, a186-BlueBlock"
3,594.9,601.05,a way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,"it, that, this","a132-PurpleBlock, a172-MysteryBlock, a187-YellowBlock"
3,608.58,611.28,uh it's this one we want now,"it, this","a133-YellowBlock, a134-MysteryBlock"
3,612.31,621.67,we are like halfway over the edge and we can just barely balance it actually we need something bigger,it,
1,612.24,624.09,we also try that that is fair if it is the rectangle we can try that,"that, that, it, that","a135-MysteryBlock, a136-PurpleBlock, a173-YellowBlock, a188-PurpleBlock, a190-BlueBlock"
2,624.31,625.08,the purple is,purple,
1,635.61,637.89,it started falling,it,
3,643.71,647.58,i think that it needs more,"that, it",
2,648.45,650.43,are they the same size though,they,
3,653.91,657.09,in then as long as we have the same on either side of that line,that,
1,659.08,660.81,keep it in that sect diagnal,"it, that",a140-RedBlock
3,664.8,666.78,how close is this though,this,
3,679.42,676.17,that might have been it that was three,"that, it, that",
2,667.65,669.67,i think that was on the line too,that,a141-MysteryBlock
2,678.55,681.48,so we said like green was ten green was twenty,"green, green","a146-MysteryBlock, a177-GreenBlock"
3,682.08,685.11,i think that might be it should we do it again just to be sure,"that, it, it",
2,682.58,683.58,yellow was fifty,yellow,
1,688.56,691.26,keep it in that sect diagnal,"it, that","a148-PurpleBlock, a178-RedBlock"
3,693.57,697.62,wait a sec ok so this actually matters how we,this,a149-PurpleBlock
3,708.39,711.24,well that's pretty unstable right there i think,that,
3,722.61,727.35,set it like all the way into the center line it's just enough room to support it,"it, it, it",
3,727.62,730.98,and i'll just kind of support this with my finger and then i'll move my finger,this,
3,744.72,747.12,and so that's not close but it'll be,"that, it",a153-RedBlock
3,747.18,749.16,that,that,
3,752.61,758.07,i think if we add another one here but we want to make sure it looks like it's straight up and down also,"it, it","a154-BlueBlock, a155-BlueBlock"
2,749.85,750.76,how much weight is that if you yeah i think you,that,
1,751.58,752.75,if we add it,it,
2,765.33,773.49,so it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,"yellow, yellow, purple, it","a156-YellowBlock, a179-GreenBlock, a189-RedBlock"
3,765.33,767.58,so i think that's it,"that, it",
2,773.52,776.46,purple and a yellow green,"purple, yellow, green",
2,776.61,780.78,and red right yellow green,"red, yellow, green","a157-RedBlock, a191-MysteryBlock"
2,780.96,783.06,it's ten,it,
2,783.15,785.43,green,green,"a158-GreenBlock, a180-PurpleBlock"
3,786.39,790.23,it's either that or like maybe ten more i just couldn't quite tell,"it, that","a159-YellowBlock, a160-BlueBlock"
3,790.89,795.21,it didn't seem like it took it much to get it to tip but also it's hard to like,"it, it, it, it, it",
3,795.42,800.49,yield ten grams of pressure i think it's that,"it, that","a161-MysteryBlock, a181-RedBlock"
3,811.32,813.57,i don't i don't think it was in the,it,
3,814.02,818.72,wait what were the ones that we had on there cause i think that might have been the same,"that, that","a162-MysteryBlock, a163-YellowBlock, a182-GreenBlock"
1,817.4,820.47,this this and this ten twenty and fifty,"this, this, this",
3,820.74,825.66,ok well we added an we used both of these so it's twenty twenty and fifty so fifty,"these, it",a164-PurpleBlock
1,842.7,846.69,actually when we added the final ten it was able to to fall,it,a166-BlueBlock
2,844.67,845.67,it started to tip,it,
3,846.75,851.19,it was about ready to fall but it didn't fall it needed to be touched so maybe it was a hundred,"it, it, it, it",
1,851.82,855.99,ok we can try that,that,
2,857.88,858.73,uh it was eighty yep,it,
1,860.06,862.35,it was eighty,it,
3,862.56,863.42,that's interesting,that,
2,865.3,870.24,if you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over,"it, it",a167-BlueBlock
2,884.08,885.34,ok cool so we could use this,this,
1,885.58,887.08,is it the second mystery block,"mystery, it",
1,907.89,911.28,there is no mystery block but we need to estimate the weight of it,"mystery, it",
1,914.34,917.79,oh everytime it caught item multiplied,it,
3,940.17,945.0,a second mystery block so i'm just wondering which two are moving about,mystery,
1,945.93,953.91,we don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,"mystery, mystery",
2,947.5,950.67,it's just so we have to estimate right,it,
1,954.0,955.98,even knowing what it is,it,
2,973.15,980.64,cause it's like the rate right of like how we're incrementing or i agree i would go with one thirty as well,it,
1,972.42,977.75,yeah that's what i think yeah that is how they are getting you incrementing,"that, that, they",
1,989.22,991.41,yeah then you can explain it,it,
3,993.48,1002.0,um i just forget the name of what it's called i don't want to like write it out,"it, it",
1,996.75,999.01,if you have any idea you can say it actually,it,
3,1003.17,1005.08,what's that like pattern called,that,
1,1005.08,1007.37,um you can call it a sequence,it,
1,1009.05,1016.07,actually the blocks start with the sequence of ten plus ten twenty twenty plus ten thirty you can explain that,that,
3,1020.51,1027.83,yeah but there's a name for the sequence i mean you can write that out i just want to keep trying to think of the name because that would be probably easier,"that, that",
3,1079.31,1083.6,so yeah that was very perceptive nice job,that,
3,1177.11,1181.97,all of them except oh wait did she give us to the blocks one by one,them,
3,1184.13,1186.17,cause we could just say that,that,
1,1182.72,1183.5,did they throw it up,"they, it",
3,1186.62,1190.58,they're all like ten grams times,they,
3,1196.22,1200.99,like numbers from the fibonacci seuquence so we expect it to be ten grams times to the seventh,it,
3,1205.16,1209.08,um but it's just cause we don't have orders of the ones that we got first,"it, that",
1,1202.73,1213.71,um i don't understant actually you say that one even if it's the same right again if you write ten into one one comma one comma two comma,"that, it",
1,1214.07,1217.94,three comma five comma eight it's second fibonacci,it,
1,1221.83,1224.75,no it's like this and we sorted them,"it, this, them",
3,1229.97,1237.92,um i mean we're definitely right it's just like how do we word it um either way is fine like the way we have it there it,"it, it, it, it",
3,1238.01,1242.0,i mean it's it's it's not super accurate but it,"it, it, it, it",
1,1239.08,1240.42,it's the same actually,it,
3,1242.36,1245.42,says the same thing so we might as well just do that,that,
1,1250.07,1252.05,yeah it's done,it,
