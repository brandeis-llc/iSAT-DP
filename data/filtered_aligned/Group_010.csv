3,55.33,57.08,okay so the red is ten grams?,red,
1,60.67,65.67,let's assume that the bigger ones are,that,
2,66.58,70.0,let's put two yeah red one as well,red,"a1-GreenBlock, a2-RedBlock, a72-BlueBlock, a126-BlueBlock, a127-GreenBlock, a128-RedBlock"
1,68.25,69.5,we can put that other one here too,that,
3,79.58,82.08,i guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten,"this, this",
3,82.97,87.91,i mean what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal they are of equal size but,"these, they",
2,87.41,90.17,they're the same uhhhh just don't want to touch it,"they, it","a3-GreenBlock, a73-BlueBlock, a129-GreenBlock, a130-BlueBlock"
3,96.5,98.0,it looks like they're fairly equal,"it, they",
3,100.84,102.85,right so then that's twenty these two are ten,"that, these",
1,104.59,106.59,that would make sense to me,that,
2,108.83,110.92,just a sec let it settle for the,it,
2,117.46,118.87,yeah they're together,they,
3,119.75,128.25,alright well now let's do these two i can already tell this one's heavier yeah,"these, this",
2,119.75,129.84,yeah they're they're equal heavier so let's put the ten one ten,"they, they","a4-PurpleBlock, a5-YellowBlock, a75-RedBlock, a76-GreenBlock, a77-RedBlock, a119-BlueBlock, a132-None, a133-GreenBlock, a134-None, a135-RedBlock"
1,136.34,142.91,i say they are equal those are the instructions i suppose,"they, those","a6-BlueBlock, a136-BlueBlock"
3,146.28,150.25,try this one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if it balances,"this, it",
3,151.46,153.0,cause i have a feeling this is a little more,this,
3,166.41,167.67,like you would be able to see it right?,it,
2,180.78,202.56,i'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like it touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red it's gonna be heavier like not equal but almost almost equal how do wait how do we know this one's twenty did we no we didn't,"red, red, it, it, it, this",a137-BlueBlock
3,184.06,202.21,yeah so let's try to put that on top and see okay so it's definitely not like fourty like thirty two thirty three what do you say cause this one's twenty this one's ten cause we did it,"that, it, this, this, it",a7-BlueBlock
2,203.33,216.41,we we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty thirty yeah,"it, this","a8-GreenBlock, a78-YellowBlock, a138-GreenBlock"
1,208.39,212.15,to begin with also like we don't really have time to do this,this,
1,223.0,225.0,um you know what let's try this,this,"a10-GreenBlock, a11-PurpleBlock, a80-YellowBlock"
1,234.11,235.39,do these make sense,these,
2,247.61,254.24,so this one's thirty and what's this one twenty right twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay,"this, this, this",
3,263.83,268.91,i mean it's not gonna go anywhere i guess it's just oh,"it, it",
2,265.91,269.13,it's more tilting to the right so less than fifty,it,
2,278.32,281.31,just a sec let this settle now yeah,this,a13-RedBlock
3,280.08,283.33,this is gonna be too heavy i think this is around yeah,"this, this",
2,283.84,286.57,this is like less than fifty less than fifty,this,
3,286.92,290.71,like if those are more than fifty then this is less yeah,"those, this",
3,295.5,301.5,i guess we're done huh i just want to feel it though i really want to see if it's the heaviest,"it, it",a14-BlueBlock
3,302.51,307.26,should i oh yeah this is fifty grams,this,"a15-YellowBlock, a81-GreenBlock, a140-YellowBlock, a141-GreenBlock"
2,303.0,305.0,yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty,"it, it, it",
1,307.81,312.48,so this was thirty right thirty this was twenty and these are tens,"this, this, these","a16-GreenBlock, a82-PurpleBlock"
2,312.89,313.67,and that's fifty,that,"a17-BlueBlock, a83-YellowBlock"
2,316.91,319.14,tens yeah so that's it,"that, it",
1,323.25,324.18,this mandate,this,
1,327.82,333.09,what are we supposed to do we are supposed do we are supposed to enter it in the laptop,it,
3,329.82,334.59,do you have more blocks or i think we're done here oh okay let's do that,that,
3,342.68,349.0,okay now help me out fifty okay green,green,
2,343.5,350.5,so the yellow one's fifty yeah green wait green's twenty,"yellow, green, green",
1,353.34,355.84,and they're two blue,"blue, they",
2,355.32,359.09,tens tens are blue blue and red yup,"blue, blue, red",
3,359.57,365.67,blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple thirty right yeah alright let's do it,"blue, purple, they, it",
2,361.92,363.41,purple's this one thirty,"purple, this",
1,366.42,373.25,you know what like i feel that is this what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right,"purple, blue, red, purple, that, this","a18-RedBlock, a84-BlueBlock"
3,373.75,382.59,no i think this is this is the one which is purple oh,"purple, this, this",
2,374.0,383.09,no no no no so like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah,"red, they, this, they, that, they, this, they",a19-RedBlock
3,383.74,386.09,lets go ahead and hit this,this,
3,387.42,390.67,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams,"red, yellow","a20-BlueBlock, a85-PurpleBlock"
2,388.42,389.17,yeah red ten given,red,
3,391.12,396.25,green is twenty i mean we're we're right right i mean we're exactly right,green,
3,398.25,403.09,no the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty okay,"red, blue, yellow",
2,405.01,407.59,where is the mystery block any idea,mystery,
3,407.84,417.67,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,"mystery, blue",
1,410.18,418.67,you have two attempts it's heavier than everything else,it,"a21-MysteryBlock, a22-PurpleBlock"
2,422.0,427.84,two attempts okay wait this one is what again fifty this is this is,"this, this, this","a23-MysteryBlock, a24-YellowBlock, a25-PurpleBlock, a88-YellowBlock, a89-PurpleBlock"
3,426.08,426.59,this is fifty,this,
3,428.82,430.07,that's that was thirty,"that, that",a90-GreenBlock
2,433.32,443.42,can we form something on one side like this place the other one so okay yeah,this,"a26-YellowBlock, a91-RedBlock, a92-MysteryBlock, a120-GreenBlock"
3,439.15,440.63,well just just try to get a feel of it,it,
1,445.5,451.75,i would say still heavier than all these blocks yeah can you grab there and hold it,"these, it","a93-MysteryBlock, a94-MysteryBlock"
2,457.59,460.34,so the yellow one's fifty,yellow,a27-YellowBlock
3,470.5,474.67,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess,that,"a29-MysteryBlock, a30-BlueBlock, a96-YellowBlock"
2,478.57,488.62,how are you how are you really holding i'm just moving blocks and seeing yeah this is lighter this is lighter if i put the ten,"this, this","a31-MysteryBlock, a32-RedBlock, a33-YellowBlock, a34-BlueBlock, a97-YellowBlock, a98-MysteryBlock, a121-BlueBlock, a125-RedBlock"
3,478.68,479.85,this is hard to say,this,
2,505.06,509.53,like like wait let's remove these two let's check this one is lighter right on the right side,"these, this","a38-MysteryBlock, a101-YellowBlock, a122-RedBlock"
3,512.89,517.92,it's hard it really it's hard to say because it depends on how strong your hands are both hands so,"it, it, it, it","a39-YellowBlock, a102-MysteryBlock"
3,519.25,526.25,i don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess we have a hundred and ten,it,"a40-MysteryBlock, a103-MysteryBlock"
2,523.0,528.0,how much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty,it,"a41-MysteryBlock, a104-MysteryBlock"
2,528.5,535.07,because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put this also feels lighter right,this,"a42-MysteryBlock, a105-YellowBlock, a123-RedBlock"
1,536.56,541.42,yeah uh maybe not difficult it is um,it,
2,545.42,546.91,yeah it's lighter but this,"it, this","a44-YellowBlock, a45-BlueBlock, a106-MysteryBlock"
2,549.9,556.08,almost same let's let's do it yeah,it,"a46-YellowBlock, a107-MysteryBlock"
1,552.5,555.25,this is um this whole block is one twenty right so,"this, this",
1,563.42,569.37,i i was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because i don't know any better,that,
2,571.75,572.5,see this,this,a47-BlueBlock
2,575.0,577.25,this feels same almost try it,"this, it","a48-YellowBlock, a108-MysteryBlock"
3,577.0,578.0,oh let's try it out,it,
1,581.0,589.17,it's strange that like you are saying that all of these stacked up were all identical to that and now these,"it, that, that, these, that, these","a49-MysteryBlock, a109-YellowBlock"
3,586.17,587.67,hundred and ten so that's like a hundred,that,
2,589.42,601.34,no no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why let let's try it yeah,"this, it, it, that, it","a50-MysteryBlock, a51-BlueBlock, a52-BlueBlock, a110-MysteyBlock"
3,596.5,603.02,so that that would put it at like a hundred because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred,"that, that, it, that, this, that","a53-MysteryBlock, a111-YellowBlock"
1,601.75,604.25,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,this,"a54-YellowBlock, a112-MysteryBlock"
3,614.67,616.41,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,"that, this, it, it",a55-BlueBlock
2,615.14,627.57,no wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred so means hundred and ten is total this yeah okay yeah sure sure sure,"this, this, this, this","a56-MysteryBlock, a57-BlueBlock, a58-BlueBlock, a59-MysteryBlock"
3,635.04,637.63,okay this is okay,this,
3,640.89,651.34,okay this is not quite correct so between the weights of the prior blocks,this,"a61-PurpleBlock, a115-YellowBlock"
1,642.92,650.75,weights of the prior blocks and use it oh okay so these are ten ten twenty thirty,"it, these","a60-YellowBlock, a113-RedBlock, a114-GreenBlock, a124-PurpleBlock"
1,652.5,666.91,fifty it's fibonacci or something right one one two three five wait eight eighty maybe yeah,it,a62-RedBlock
3,655.31,666.42,wait wait what's two three five eight thirteen twenty eighty yeah that's fibonacci definitely,that,a63-MysteryBlock
1,667.63,669.41,ah i mean that's,that,
2,668.13,677.25,ten ten this is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah that's fifty,"this, that","a64-GreenBlock, a65-YellowBlock"
2,677.75,685.81,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then that's a pattern that's it,"that, that, it",a116-MysteryBlock
3,681.34,692.64,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,"that, this, this","a66-RedBlock, a67-BlueBlock"
2,692.91,704.0,yeah it's is is there any other series i'm not missing out i mean ten twenty thirty fifty,it,
3,693.27,705.56,is that the pattern or is that you know just use those weights right that that is true anyway and also i mean,"that, that, those, that, that","a68-MysteryBlock, a69-MysteryBlock"
3,722.25,726.0,this is eight rb i think that that is eighty,"this, that, that",a70-MysteryBlock
1,727.0,728.5,this is nine rb so,this,a117-YellowBlock
3,730.0,731.5,oh no they don't have any hints here,they,a118-PurpleBlock
3,737.02,741.65,it's cool we have to i guess eighty alright,it,
2,758.06,758.34,what's this,this,
1,765.12,766.67,can you read it out loud or something,it,
3,766.92,771.42,well the factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block,"mystery, that",
3,771.68,780.09,you have two opportunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one two sentences how you determined your estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block,mystery,
1,781.87,792.67,fibonacci like let's say that's the first one according to our translate thirteen one thirty,that,
2,784.03,795.67,eight that's the first one so eight plus five thirteen yeah there is one thirty eight plus five,that,
3,784.47,786.52,is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,"mystery, mystery, that",
2,796.75,797.25,just do it,it,
3,800.5,801.71,so that was the first mystery block,"mystery, that",
3,802.31,810.31,and we already did that now this is yeah oh okay okay okay okay right,"that, this",
2,803.38,809.83,yeah the second one means according to that statement is the second one mystery block two,"mystery, that",
1,814.08,816.56,makes sense to me as much sense as i can make of it,it,
2,816.17,819.15,yeah one thirty that's it,"that, it",
2,821.25,822.75,follows fibonacci series that's it,"that, it",
2,854.83,859.07,and it works and it works that's it,"it, it, that, it",
3,864.27,867.67,yeah it's one thirty it is i know that hang on a second one thirty,"it, it, that",
2,881.02,889.17,yeah so we got it right do not for fall but please identify yay we completed it yeah,"it, it",
3,884.57,888.92,okay so yeah fibonacci is what it is,it,
3,890.41,892.17,well they should ask this in gres,"they, this",
