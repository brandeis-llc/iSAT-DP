22,3,82.97,87.91,i mean what why didn't we first check out whether [these] two are equal [they] are of equal size but,,[rb] [rb]
24,2,87.41,90.17,[they]'re the same uhhhh just don't want to touch [it],"a3-GreenBlock, a73-BlueBlock, a129-GreenBlock, a130-BlueBlock",[rb] [-]
25,3,96.5,98,[it] looks like [they]'re fairly equal,,[-] [rb]
27,3,100.84,102.85,right so then [that]'s twenty [these] two are ten,,[g] [rb]
29,1,104.59,106.59,[that] would make sense to me,,[-]
30,2,108.83,110.92,just a sec let [it] settle for the,,[-]
34,2,117.46,118.87,yeah [they]'re together,,[rb]

44,3,146.28,150.25,try [this] one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if [it] balances,,[b] [-]
46,3,151.46,153,cause i have a feeling [this] is a little more,,[p]
49,3,166.41,167.67,like you would be able to see [it] right?,,[-]
52,2,180.78,202.56,i'm guessing [it]'s a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like [it] touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red [it]'s gonna be heavier like not equal but almost almost equal how do wait how do we know [this] one's twenty did we no we didn't,a137-BlueBlock,[-] [-] [rbg] [g]
53,3,184.06,202.21,yeah so let's try to put [that] on top and see okay so [it]'s definitely not like fourty like thirty two thirty three what do you say cause [this] one's twenty [this] one's ten cause we did [it],a7-BlueBlock,[b] [-] [g] [r] [-]
54,2,203.33,216.41,we we moved [it] and checked the two tens remember we didn't do [this] one okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty thirty yeah,"a8-GreenBlock, a78-YellowBlock, a138-GreenBlock",[g] [g]
56,1,208.39,212.15,to begin with also like we don't really have time to do [this],,[-]

62,1,234.11,235.39,do [these] make sense,,[gpy]
63,2,247.61,254.24,so [this] one's thirty and what's [this] one twenty right twenty okay so [this] one's gonna be fifty okay,,[p] [g] [y]
67,3,263.83,268.91,i mean [it]'s not gonna go anywhere i guess [it]'s just oh,,[-] [-]
68,2,265.91,269.13,[it]'s more tilting to the right so less than fifty,,[-]
72,2,278.32,281.31,just a sec let [this] settle now yeah,a13-RedBlock,[-]
73,3,280.08,283.33,[this] is gonna be too heavy i think [this] is around yeah,,[-] [-]
74,2,283.84,286.57,[this] is like less than fifty less than fifty,,[y]
76,3,286.92,290.71,like if [those] are more than fifty then [this] is less yeah,,[gp] [y]
78,3,295.5,301.5,i guess we're done huh i just want to feel [it] though i really want to see if [it]'s the heaviest,a14-BlueBlock,[y] [y]
80,3,302.51,307.26,should i oh yeah [this] is fifty grams,"a15-YellowBlock, a81-GreenBlock, a140-YellowBlock, a141-GreenBlock",[y]
81,2,303,305,yeah yeah [it]'s [it]'s almost settled down so [it]'s less than fifty,,[-] [-] [y]
82,1,307.81,312.48,so [this] was thirty right thirty [this] was twenty and [these] are tens,"a16-GreenBlock, a82-PurpleBlock",[p] [g] [rb]
85,2,312.89,313.67,and [that]'s fifty,"a17-BlueBlock, a83-YellowBlock",[y]

103,2,361.92,363.41,purple's [this] one thirty,,[p]
104,1,366.42,373.25,you know what like i feel [that] is [this] what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right,"a18-RedBlock, a84-BlueBlock",[-] [br]
105,3,373.75,382.59,no i think [this] is [this] is the one which is purple oh,,[p] [p]
106,2,374,383.09,no no no no so like [they] gave the weight of [this] one [they] gave the weight of the red one so [that]'s why [they] didn't include [this] one [they] already gave us yeah,a19-RedBlock,[-] [r] [-] [-] [-] [r] [-]
108,3,383.74,386.09,lets go ahead and hit [this],,[-]
109,3,387.42,390.67,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams,"a20-BlueBlock, a85-PurpleBlock",
110,2,388.42,389.17,yeah red ten given,,
111,3,391.12,396.25,green is twenty i mean we're we're right right i mean we're exactly right,,
113,3,398.25,403.09,no the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty okay,,
115,2,405.01,407.59,where is the mystery block any idea,,
116,3,407.84,417.67,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,,
117,1,410.18,418.67,you have two attempts [it]'s heavier than everything else,"a21-MysteryBlock, a22-PurpleBlock",[m]
121,2,422,427.84,two attempts okay wait [this] one is what again fifty [this] is [this] is,"a23-MysteryBlock, a24-YellowBlock, a25-PurpleBlock, a88-YellowBlock, a89-PurpleBlock",[y] [y] [p]
122,3,426.08,426.59,[this] is fifty,,[y]
123,3,428.82,430.07,[that]'s [that] was thirty,a90-GreenBlock,[p] [p]
126,2,433.32,443.42,can we form something on one side like [this] place the other one so okay yeah,"a26-YellowBlock, a91-RedBlock, a92-MysteryBlock, a120-GreenBlock",[-]
127,3,439.15,440.63,well just just try to get a feel of [it],,[m]
128,1,445.5,451.75,i would say still heavier than all [these] blocks yeah can you grab there and hold [it],"a93-MysteryBlock, a94-MysteryBlock",[m] [rbgpy]
132,2,457.59,460.34,so the yellow one's fifty,a27-YellowBlock,
136,3,470.5,474.67,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten [that] would be my guess,"a29-MysteryBlock, a30-BlueBlock, a96-YellowBlock",[-]
139,2,478.57,488.62,how are you how are you really holding i'm just moving blocks and seeing yeah [this] is lighter [this] is lighter if i put the ten,"a31-MysteryBlock, a32-RedBlock, a33-YellowBlock, a34-BlueBlock, a97-YellowBlock, a98-MysteryBlock, a121-BlueBlock, a125-RedBlock",[rbgpy] [rbgpy]
140,3,478.68,479.85,[this] is hard to say,,[-]
148,2,505.06,509.53,like like wait let's remove [these] two let's check [this] one is lighter right on the right side,"a38-MysteryBlock, a101-YellowBlock, a122-RedBlock",[rb] [ypg]
150,3,512.89,517.92,[it]'s hard [it] really [it]'s hard to say because [it] depends on how strong your hands are both hands so,"a39-YellowBlock, a102-MysteryBlock",[-] [-] [-] [-]
151,3,519.25,526.25,i don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know [it] could be is my guess we have a hundred and ten,"a40-MysteryBlock, a103-MysteryBlock",[m]
152,2,523,528,how much is [it] so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty,"a41-MysteryBlock, a104-MysteryBlock",[ypg]
153,2,528.5,535.07,because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put [this] also feels lighter right,"a42-MysteryBlock, a105-YellowBlock, a123-RedBlock",[ypgr]
155,1,536.56,541.42,yeah uh maybe not difficult [it] is um,,[-]
157,2,545.42,546.91,yeah [it]'s lighter but [this],"a44-YellowBlock, a45-BlueBlock, a106-MysteryBlock",[ypgr] [ypgrb]
158,2,549.9,556.08,almost same let's let's do [it] yeah,"a46-YellowBlock, a107-MysteryBlock",[-]
160,1,552.5,555.25,[this] is um [this] whole block is one twenty right so,,[ypgrb] [ypgrb]
165,1,563.42,569.37,i i was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but [that] also makes sense because i don't know any better,,[-]
166,2,571.75,572.5,see [this],a47-BlueBlock,[-]
167,2,575,577.25,[this] feels same almost try [it],"a48-YellowBlock, a108-MysteryBlock",[rbgpym] [-]
168,3,577,578,oh let's try [it] out,,[-]
169,1,581,589.17,[it]'s strange [that] like you are saying [that] all of [these] stacked up were all identical to [that] and now [these],"a49-MysteryBlock, a109-YellowBlock",[-] [-] [-] [ypgr] [mb] [ypgr]
171,3,586.17,587.67,hundred and ten so [that]'s like a hundred,,[mb]
172,2,589.42,601.34,no no no no so the thing is like when you put [this] [it] feels almost same because [it]'s just ten gram difference [that]'s why let let's try [it] yeah,"a50-MysteryBlock, a51-BlueBlock, a52-BlueBlock, a110-MysteyBlock",[b] [rbgpym] [b] [-] [-]
173,3,596.5,603.02,so [that] [that] would put [it] at like a hundred because [that] one would be a hundred and ten and [this] is a hundred ten so [that]'s hundred,"a53-MysteryBlock, a111-YellowBlock",[-] [-] [m] [ypgr] [mb] [m]
174,1,601.75,604.25,i mean [this] is very difficult why don't we just guess,"a54-YellowBlock, a112-MysteryBlock",[-]
177,3,614.67,616.41,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no [that]'s what i said [this] is alone [it]'s [it]'s hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,a55-BlueBlock,[-] [-] [-] [-]
178,2,615.14,627.57,no wait wait [this] is hundred [this] is hundred [this] is hundred so means hundred and ten is total [this] yeah okay yeah sure sure sure,"a56-MysteryBlock, a57-BlueBlock, a58-BlueBlock, a59-MysteryBlock",[m] [m] [m] [m]
181,3,635.04,637.63,okay [this] is okay,,[-]
183,3,640.89,651.34,okay [this] is not quite correct so between the weights of the prior blocks,"a61-PurpleBlock, a115-YellowBlock",[-]
184,1,642.92,650.75,weights of the prior blocks and use [it] oh okay so [these] are ten ten twenty thirty,"a60-YellowBlock, a113-RedBlock, a114-GreenBlock, a124-PurpleBlock",[-] [rbgpy]
186,1,652.5,666.91,fifty [it]'s fibonacci or something right one one two three five wait eight eighty maybe yeah,a62-RedBlock,[-]
187,3,655.31,666.42,wait wait what's two three five eight thirteen twenty eighty yeah [that]'s fibonacci definitely,a63-MysteryBlock,[-]
189,1,667.63,669.41,ah i mean [that]'s,,[-]
190,2,668.13,677.25,ten ten [this] is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah [that]'s fifty,"a64-GreenBlock, a65-YellowBlock",[g] [y]
191,2,677.75,685.81,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then [that]'s a pattern [that]'s [it],a116-MysteryBlock,[-] [-] [-]
192,3,681.34,692.64,like just because of just becasuse [that]'s fibonacci because i'm not sure what [this] hint is [this] is saying relationship between the weights which means,"a66-RedBlock, a67-BlueBlock",[-] [-] [-]
194,2,692.91,704,yeah [it]'s is is there any other series i'm not missing out i mean ten twenty thirty fifty,,[-]
195,3,693.27,705.56,is [that] the pattern or is [that] you know just use [those] weights right [that] [that] is true anyway and also i mean,"a68-MysteryBlock, a69-MysteryBlock",[-] [-] [-] [-] [-]
200,3,722.25,726,[this] is eight rb i think [that] [that] is eighty,a70-MysteryBlock,[m] [m] [m]
202,1,727,728.5,[this] is nine rb so,a117-YellowBlock,[y]
203,3,730,731.5,oh no [they] don't have any hints here,a118-PurpleBlock,[-]
205,3,737.02,741.65,[it]'s cool we have to i guess eighty alright,,[-]
